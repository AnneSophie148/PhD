<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Concerted infestation of wheat by Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov, the Russian wheat aphid) leads to extensive economic losses if untreated.</s><s>The preferred hosts of this specialized aphid are wheat, barley, related cereals, and some grasses.</s><s>This contrasts it to other well studied generalist aphid pests, e.g., Myzus persicae and Bemisia tabaci.</s><s>D. noxia only reproduces asexually through parthenogenesis in most regions of its distribution and is not effective in harboring and transmitting viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cronj√®, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>These attributes make it a useful system to study monocotyledonousarthropod and specialized plant-arthropod interactions.</s><s>With completion of its genome sequence, more tools are becoming available, even though annotation shortcomings and public availability impede progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Nicholson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burger and Botha, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>D. noxia occurs as wingless females (apterous) in affected areas, but can readily develop wings (alate) under adverse conditions.</s><s>This, coupled with its rapid reproduction rate, can detrimentally affect infected fields in short periods of time and once the aphid colonizes susceptible wheat, it accrues in large numbers per plants.</s><s>This level of prolonged and intensive feeding results in leaf rolling and the formation of chlorotic lesions that extend to chlorotic streaking in highly susceptible plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(du Toit and Aalsberg, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>Although not isolated yet, it is hypothesized that extensive effector secretion induces the different phenotypic effects when feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nicolis and Venter, 2018)</ref>.</s><s>The aphid is unique in that it changes the turgor pressure in leaf cells to allow the leaves to roll up.</s><s>This provides a protected environment for the aphids against predatory insects like wasps and makes it difficult to treat infestations with contact insecticides.</s><s>Severe infestation results in lowered yield due to less or malformed seed production, head trapping with no seed production, and ultimately the death of plants.</s><s>The development of chlorotic lesions and streaking is the result of chloroplast damage, possibly to create a photosynthate sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Botha et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Identification of effector proteins from D. noxia should allow for the elucidation of the pathways involved with the phenotypical responses that are induced in the infested wheat plants.</s></p><p><s>Aphids, like pathogens, have intimate relationships with host plants.</s><s>During the establishment of this feeding relationship, D. noxia, like other aphids, will alight on the wheat plant and probe with its stylet for a suitable feeding location.</s><s>This probing results in the aphid inserting its stylet between mesophyll cells.</s><s>As the stylet moves inter-cellularly occasional probing into adjacent cells occur, possibly to determine its location in the leaf.</s><s>Once the sieve tube is found, the aphid will start ingesting phloem and occasionally extract its stylet and insert it into the xylem to drink water <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tjallingii, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Will et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>This intimate interaction with plant cells exposes the aphid to the innate immune response and the secretion of gelling saliva during probing protects against this contact.</s><s>This thicker saliva forms a protective layer around the stylet and also plugs holes made into cells while the stylet travels through the leaf.</s><s>Once the stylet penetrates the sieve tube, the aphid produces copious amounts of watery saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tjallingii, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Will et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>This functions in the establishment of a feeding site and releases effector proteins into the phloem to allow extended feeding at a site <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bos et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Incorporation of resistance genes (Dn) into wheat cultivars is the best strategy to combat D. noxia.</s><s>There are currently ca.</s><s>14 identified Dn-genes that are used to varying degrees in breeding programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lapitan et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>To date, only Dn 2401 was successfully identified as Epoxide hydrolase 2 through long-read sequencing, but this still needs functional validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tulpov√° et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>However, the development of new resistance breaking D. noxia biotypes is necessitating the continued search for new resistance sources and this lack of knowledge on the plant resistance genes and the effector proteins from D. noxia hampers our understanding of the interaction.</s><s>Although several studies into gene regulation in wheat infested by D. noxia were performed, only one study focused on the regulation and role of small RNA (sRNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nicolis et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>This regulation is effected through the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), where the miRNA pairs with the ARGONAUTE (AGO) effector protein complex that sequesters the target mRNA based on sequence similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Iwakawa and Tomari, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The RISC can silence expression of a gene through cleavage or translational repression depending on the similarity in the miRNA:mRNA complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baulcombe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Voinnet, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Central to the RISC is the AGO effector proteins that are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The AGO proteins contain four functional domains with the PAZ, MID and PIWI domains conserved and the N-domain displaying the most variation between different species <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tolia and Joshua-Tor, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Singh et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The PAZ and MID domains play a role in binding the 5'monophosphorylated and the 3' nucleotides of the sRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Takeda et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Mutation studies in Drosophila melanogaster indicated that the loss of the PAZ domain does not result in the loss of sRNA binding; however, shorter sRNA molecule binding is favored <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hur et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In plants, this may differ, as the association with the sRNA is based on the interaction with the 5'monophosphorylated nucleotide <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tolia and Joshua-Tor, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The PIWI domain effects the cleavage of the associated mRNA and mutation of conserved residues results in a reduction of mRNA suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hur et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Loss of the N-domain results in a constitutive activation of PIWI-based cleavage of sRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hur et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>These structural differences and their influence on regulation of gene expression hint at a complex interplay between the different AGO proteins, sRNAs, and their mRNA targets.</s></p><p><s>Limited knowledge of the wheat-D.</s><s>noxia interaction hampers our efforts to breed more durable wheat cultivars.</s><s>D. noxia adapts at an increasing rate with prolonged exposure to the limited number of Dn-genes deployed in the field.</s><s>Interestingly, a new biotype may have the ability to overcome multiple resistance genes, even ones that were not deployed in the field in large numbers.</s><s>This was evident when the second South African biotype (RWASA2) was detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jankielsohn, 2016)</ref> and it developed resistance against Dn1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and Dn2006 simultaneously.</s><s>These Dn-genes were mapped to different chromosomes in the wheat genome and they could be related genes from a similar family and the development of a new effector possibly affects all four.</s><s>This implies that these genes make use of a dedicated arthropod resistance pathway that is targeted and perturbed by an effector or effectors that target components of this pathway.</s><s>Indeed, the discovery of TaAdnr1, an integrated-domain nucleotidebinding leucine-rich repeat (NLR-ID), that functions similarly to RRS1 of Arabidopsis supports the occurrence of dedicated resistance response pathways in wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nicolis and Venter, 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Regulation of the Dn-genes and pathways associated with the resistance response is influenced by sRNA through the RISC.</s><s>To complement our knowledge on this part of the plant-arthropod pest interaction, we have studied the role of an AGO5-like protein through functional characterization.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The D. noxia resistant wheat line Tugela DN carries the Dn1 resistance gene that imparts antibiosis against D. noxia.</s></p><p><s>Antibiosis manifests through an impairment of the growth, development, and survival of D. noxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(du Toit, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>This is observed phenotypically in plants by localized cell death lesions, similar to that observed for the hypersensitive response in plantpathogen interactions, and low numbers of aphids occurring on the plants.</s><s>In the near isogenic line Tugela, that lacks Dn1, aphid numbers increase rapidly and the plant displays the development of chlorotic lesions and leaf rolling.</s><s>The exact pathways that are impaired to induce these phenotypic changes are unknown, but turgor pressure is most probable affected to induce leaf rolling.</s><s>Identification of genes that play a role in the regulation of these pathways will assist in dissecting the intricate interplay that concludes in a resistance response.</s><s>In this study, TaAGO5 was differentially regulated in the susceptible cultivar when compared to the resistant.</s><s>We postulated that it is upregulated in the susceptible plant to increase regulation of stress related genes, or that the aphid induces this response to coerce the plant into leveraging a non-specific response similar to pests and pathogens manipulating the jasmonic acid pathway to circumvent defense responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Knockdown of TaAGO5 in D. noxia resistant Tugela DN resulted in a highly susceptible phenotype with increased aphid fitness and fecundity observed.</s><s>This would suggest that TaAGO5 plays a significant role in regulation of the wheat defense response against D. noxia and possibly to other insect attacks as well.</s><s>This role is similar to that observed for NaAGO8 in Nicotiana tabacum against Manduca sexta.</s><s>Results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pradhan et al. (2017)</ref> suggested this holds true for NaAGO5.</s><s>Knockdown of NaAGO8 directly affected phytohormone biosynthesis and the production of nicotine, diterpenoid glycosides, and phenolamides under MYB8 transcription factor regulation.</s><s>Both MYB8 and MYB5 transcription factors regulate the phenylpropanoid pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Du et al., 2012)</ref> with TaMYB5 also identified to function in the wheat-D.</s><s>noxia interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nicolis et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, this may point to a similar regulation of the phytohormone and secondary metabolite pathways in the wheat-D.</s><s>noxia interaction when compared with NaAGO8 after arthropod feeding.</s><s>The extent of the role that TaAGO5 plays in this is not clear; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pradhan et al. (2017)</ref>, proposes that AGO5 and AGO8 proteins may have overlapping targets based on similarity in their roles during arthropod herbivory.</s><s>This may hold true for TaAGO5 and TaAGO8 proteins during the wheat defense response against the intimate feeding by D. noxia.</s><s>Regulation effected through TaAGO5 proteins may differ marginally between different wheataphid interactions as wheat response against D. noxia is affected by the incorporated resistance gene type and the aphid biotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Botha et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Smith et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Feeding by D. noxia on susceptible and resistant wheat induced similar responses in TaAGO5 regulation for susceptible plants, where a twofold induction was observed 1 h after the aphids were placed on the plants.</s><s>This increased steadily and peaked at threefold induction at 48 h.</s><s>Similarly, NaAGO5 was differentially regulated in N. tabacum by M. sexta larvae oral secretions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pradhan et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Oral secretions elicited a sixand threefold increase in NaAGO5 and 8 at 18 h.</s><s>This differential regulation in response to M. sexta oral secretions was only observed for NaAGO5 and 8.</s><s>In our study, aphids were allowed to feed freely and this may explain the lower fold expression changes observed when compared to NaAGO5.</s><s>The complex interplay between the wheat plant and D. noxia feeding will affect both the aphids and the plant as the feeding progresses and aphids modulate their saliva composition and secrete effector proteins into plants to address the plant's feeding responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mugford et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the plant response over time will be affected by the aphid.</s><s>This is not the case when exposing plants to saliva for extended durations where the plant will continue to respond only to the presence of the initial composition of the salivary proteins and not to the ever changing barrage of effectors and salivary proteins produced by the aphid in response to the plant.</s><s>Due to the complexities of studying plant-arthropod interactions, the majority of aphid salivary studies are performed in artificial diets or focus on single proteins and their effects on the plant and this does not allow for the elucidation of aphid salivary modulation during prolonged feeding.</s><s>How this D. noxia salivary modulation affect wheat plants is not clear.</s></p><p><s>TaAGO5 is upregulated in the untreated Tugela DN and the empty VIGS vector control for Tugela DN, but not in the susceptible Tugela line when tested at 5 days after infestation.</s><s>AGO proteins interact with virus and viroid sRNAs.</s><s>RISCs that include AGO1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 can bind to virus sRNA and Arabidopsis AGO5 can bind potato virus X (PVX) sRNA in N. tabacum and suppress the infection thereof, but only in the presence of an intact AGO2 interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brosseau and Moffett, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This proposes a virus response for TaAGO5, but only in the resistant wheat line.</s><s>Infestation with D. noxia decreased this expression but not significantly.</s><s>The upregulation of TaAGO5 in Tugela DN occurs at a later stage during the infestation as there was no regulation detected during the time trial that spanned the initial 48 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The knockdown levels of AGO proteins were only tested at 5 days post infestation and 10 days after virus inoculation.</s><s>These results suggest that TaAGO5 is expressed early on in D. noxia infested susceptible wheat and later in virus response in resistant wheat.</s><s>These early expression levels are concomitant with that seen for the virus infection in the resistant line and the levels peak for both susceptible and resistant lines at threefold above the control.</s></p><p><s>The role of AGO5 proteins in viral defense is closely linked to AGO2 proteins.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brosseau and Moffett (2015)</ref> proposed that AGO2 proteins function in the virus infected leaf and once the virus overcomes this response, the AGO5 protein is induced systemically.</s><s>This may be why TaAGO5 regulation in response to virus infection was only observed in Tugela DN.</s><s>TaAGO2 regulation was not detected under the experimental conditions used in this study.</s><s>This is most probably due to the testing of the third leaf of the wheat plants.</s><s>The inoculation with BSMV was performed on the second leaf at the emergence of the third leaf and thus only virus particles that moved into the third leaf will induce this systemic effect.</s><s>The difference between the susceptible and resistance line may lie in more free movement of the virus within the susceptible plant, with underlying resistance restraining this movement in the resistant plant.</s><s>This may also lead to the lowered levels of knockdown observed for TaAGO5 in Tugela DN.</s><s>This lower perturbation of TaAGO5 with a drastic phenotypical response hints at an important role for TaAGO5 in underlying resistance responses, at minimum against viruses and aphids, but possibly in more interactions with arthropods and other viruses.</s><s>AGO2 and 5 proteins were shown to act nonredundantly but additively against viruses and it was proposed that AGO5 is a follow on systemic response of AGO2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brosseau and Moffett, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In the absence of detection of increased levels of TaAGO2 in our experiments, we can speculate that TaAGO5 and TaAGO2 proteins will also act additively in this interaction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>We postulated that TaAGO5 is upregulated by the susceptible plant to regulate more stress related genes.</s><s>Alternatively, that D. noxia induces this response to coerce the plant into leveraging a non-specific response, similar to pests and pathogens manipulating the jasmonic acid pathway to circumvent defense responses.</s><s>Thus, increased TaAGO5 expression in the susceptible Tugela cultivar may perturb phytohormone production and improve D. noxia performance in this cultivar, while this is not evident in resistant Tugela DN.</s><s>The regulation of TaAGO5 in the empty virus vector control provides evidence that this gene plays a role in viral response that is similar to that observed in dicotyledonous plants.</s><s>It would be interesting to study this in other aphid interactions, where viruses are vectored by aphids.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Expression analysis of TaAGO5 in D. noxia susceptible Tugela and resistant Tugela DN isogenic lines.</s><s>Differential expression was measured against the standardized 0 hpi as control.</s><s>Values are the means of three biological repetitions with significantly different regulation indicated by *p ‚â§ 0.05, **p ‚â§ 0.01, and ***p ‚â§ 0.005 between cultivars.</s><s>Different letters indicate time points that are significantly different to 0 hpi (p ‚â§ 0.05) as determined by ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,311.95,69.02,228.00,118.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>
