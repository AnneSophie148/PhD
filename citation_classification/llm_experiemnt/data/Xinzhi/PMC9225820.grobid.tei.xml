<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>When the expression of juvenile hormone and 20E-related genes was downregulated, the expression of E74 was reduced significantly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), suggesting that both juvenile hormone signaling and ecdysone signaling may affect the transcription of E74.</s><s>However, when the expression of E74 was downregulated, more juvenile hormonerelated genes were affected in transcription than 20E-related genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), indicating the complex regulatory network of E74, which requires further investigation in the future.</s><s>The cascade model of 20E-regulated polytene chromosome expansion indicates that after 20E forms a complex with its receptors, it can accurately induce the production of early puff.</s><s>E74 is located in the polytene chromosome 74EF puff position.</s><s>Drosophila E74 is required for metamorphosis and plays a role in a cascade model of 20E-regulated polytene expansion <ref type="bibr">(Fletcher et al. 1995)</ref>.</s><s>βFtz-F1 is an orphan nuclear receptor defining the acquisition of competence to 20E in the mosquito through JH III-mediated posttranscriptional control of βFTZ-F1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Zhu et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The βFTZ-F1 protein appears after exposure to JH III <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Zhu et al. 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Comparing our developmental expression profiles of NlE74 with a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sun et al. 2018)</ref>, we found that the expression profiles were generally similar: for example, NlE74 was expressed in the first-to fifth-instar nymphs, and the expression level was relatively stable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>It has high expression in the ovary and midgut of short-winged adults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>We found that after downregulating E74 and βFtz-F1 together, the mortality rate of N. lugens during metamorphosis was higher than that of downregulating E74 and βFtz-F1 alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>The expression of E74 was significantly decreased after downregulating βFtz-F1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the expression of βFtz-F1 was significantly decreased after downregulating E74 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that E74 and βFtz-F1 play critical roles at the transcriptional level in the cascade model of 20E-regulated polytene expansion and likely, metamorphosis.</s><s>In Aedes aegypti females, receptor-bound 20E activates the transcription of early genes, including E74, whose protein products are involved in the transcriptional regulation of YPP genes such as Vg <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Roy et al. 2018</ref>).</s><s>The fat body can transcribe a large amount of previtellogenin mRNA.</s><s>A large amount of yolk precursor protein is produced and transported into the oocyte.</s><s>We found that the ovaries of N. lugens developed slowly after downregulating E74 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The number of eggs laid after downregulating E74 was lower than that of the control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The expression of Vg decreased after downregulating E74 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), which is consistent with a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sun et al. 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Vg protein levels decreased after downregulating E74 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with the qRT-PCR results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Thus, N. lugens E74 plays a crucial role in the formation of yolk and reproduction.</s><s>It is an important link in the cascade model of 20E-regulated polytene chromosome expansion, and likely, in metamorphosis and ovary development.</s><s>Cis-elements binding Fushi tarazu (Ftz) and E74 were identified within the promoter region of N. lugens angiotensin converting enzyme (NlACE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sun et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>βFtz-F1 is a co-factor to Ftz <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Yussa et al. 2001)</ref>.</s><s>We surmise that βFtz-F1 possibly facilitates the binding of Ftz or E74 to the DNA of the promoter region.</s><s>Furthermore, E74 and βFtz-F1 have some common functions (such as regulating molting) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) and regulate the expression of each other (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), and we surmise that they may interact with each other genetically.</s><s>Future studies, such as on protein-protein interactions, would further help to reveal their interaction.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we found that E74 played a vital role in development, metamorphosis and reproduction.</s><s>The findings also help to further our understanding of the interaction between E74 and βFtz-F1.</s><s>This study provides better knowledge for the cascade model of 20E-regulated polytene chromosome expansion and provides a basis for the future development of new target-based pesticides and new methods for the effective control of N. lugens.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1
