<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Knowledge on the vector species responsible for the spread of X. fastidiosa is critical for understanding the epidemiology and for developing adequate control measures to reduce the impact of the diseases caused by this vector-borne bacterium.</s><s>We carried out transmission tests on olives, cherry, almond, myrtle-leaf milkwort, and periwinkle plants, using three spittlebugs, P. spumarius, P. italosignus, and N. campestris, and the planthopper L. tunetana.</s><s>The experiments herein described showed that, besides P. spumarius, two additional spittlebug species are competent vectors of the strain of X. fastidiosa subsp.</s><s>pauca ST53 associated with the severe epidemics in Apulia (southern Italy).</s><s>Conversely, the negative results obtained with L. tunetana, a planthopper species that we found to be abundant on the olive canopies, represent an indirect experimental confirmation of the phloem-feeding behavior of this insect and a further confirmation that phloem-feeders may occasionally ingest X. fastidiosa cells, thus testing Xylella-positive, but they are unable to transmit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29]</ref>, as demonstrated in our experiments.</s><s>It has to be noted that, during the transmission experiments, lower survival rates were recorded on source and recipient plants for L. tunetana compared to the spittlebugs.</s><s>However, even if the low survival rates could impair the transmission efficiency, it should be considered that, in previous experiments, high mortalities were recorded for P. spumarius on oleander plants, but still high transmission rates were obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>With regard to the host plants, the overall results showed that these three spittlebugs were able to transmit the bacterium to olive and myrtle-leaf milkwort.</s><s>On the contrary, insect transmission to cherry was very inefficient (only one plant exposed to P. italosignus became infected), and, under our semi-field experimental conditions, neither P. spumarius nor P. italosignus were able to transmit to almond.</s><s>This is in line with the field observations, indicating that, in the olive infected area, few almond and cherry plants are infected.</s><s>Actually, in a recent survey in the heavily infected area, while 100% of the olives sampled in different foci tested positive, the rate of positive almond trees was as low as 20-25% (Saponari, unpublished data).</s></p><p><s>P. italosignus was rarely found in the olive groves surveyed in the past three years in the infected area where olive is the predominant crop, while its presence has been recorded in the central and northern part of the Apulia region, where a larger diversity exists in the agricultural crops, and, in the event of an expansion of the pathogen toward the north of the Apulia region, this vector species may play an important role in transmitting the bacterium to different crop species.</s><s>With regard to the host preference of P. italosignus, while it is well known that nymphs develop exclusively on asphodel (Asphodelus spp.), this also serves as a host plant for oviposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; limited information is available for the adults.</s><s>Given its competence for X. fastidiosa transmission, developing knowledge on the biology, population dynamics and abundance will be crucial for an effective pest management strategy in case of the spreading of X. fastidiosa in agro-ecosystems where this species is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Juveniles and adults of N. campestris are widely polyphagous, although they have a different host preference and ecological niches than P. spumarius.</s><s>Indeed, previous surveys carried out on the ground vegetation of the Apulian olive groves indicated that the population density of the nymphs of N. campestris was about 10 times lower than P. spumarius <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>This is in line with the lower population density monitored during our surveys.</s><s>Indeed, similar results were recently obtained in Spain by Morente et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, where adults of N. campestris were never caught on olive canopies, and in olive groves of the Bari province of Apulia, where population densities of N. campestris were consistently lower than those of P. spumarius <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is worth noting that, while the two species of Philaenus seem to transmit X. fastidiosa with similar efficiencies, N. campestris was always less efficient than both Philaenus species in transmitting X. fastidiosa to olive and myrtle-leaf milkwort.</s></p><p><s>The systematic surveys conducted in 2016 and 2017 provided further evidence on the population dynamics and seasonal abundance of the P. spumarius and N. campestris in the olive groves and seasonal prevalence of Xylella-positive specimens of these two spittlebug species.</s><s>P. spumarius is clearly the most abundant Auchenorrhyncha in the olive groves, confirming the preliminary data collected during the surveys carried in the infected area at the early stage of the epidemics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Under the monitored field conditions, Xylella-positive specimens of P. spumarius started to be detected soon after the emergence of the adults in early May and their incidence increased throughout the season.</s><s>This indicates that, as soon the adults start to move to the olive canopies, they are able to acquire the bacterium.</s><s>For an effective and sustainable control strategies, efforts should be made in the early phase of the adult season, with the attempt to reduce as much as possible the number of adults visiting the infected olive canopies.</s><s>An increasing proportion of Xylella-positive specimens was recorded over the season, regardless of the vegetation compartment.</s><s>If we consider that border plants present in our plots were non-hosts of the bacterium and that X. fastidiosa infections on herbaceous species (ground vegetation) are rare and have been detected only in autumn, the infected spittlebugs detected on border plants and ground vegetation throughout the season are most probably the result of a continuous dispersion of the vector insects from the olive canopies, where they acquire the bacterium, to other suitable hosts present in the orchards.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, our results clearly indicate that the occurrence of Xylella-positive individuals of N. campestris is significantly lower than P. spumarius, and generally limited to the initial part of the season (May).</s><s>This is likely due to the non-preference of this species for olive <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which is the main host of X. fastidiosa in the area.</s><s>Such evidence is important for pest risk assessment and vector management in different agro-ecosystems, considering that both species are quite common and widespread in several European countries, including those where X. fastidiosa has been recently detected.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the seasonal fluctuation of the populations, during the two years, similar trends were recorded for both spittlebugs, with a peak in May soon after the emergence of the adults.</s><s>Later in the season, a decrease of the populations is observed for both P. spumarius and N. campestris on the olive canopies, with the complete disappearance of the latter species.</s><s>At the same time, an increase of population density is observed for the border plants, where most probably they find tender shoots for feeding and more suitable microclimatic conditions.</s><s>The trends observed in the Apulian olive groves are quite similar to those recorded in Spain by Morente et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, where a similar migration pattern occurs, although, in our conditions, P. spumarius never disappear from the olive canopies, indicating that, under the Apulian conditions, there is a continuous risk of bacterial infections in olives over the spittlebug adult season.</s></p></div>
