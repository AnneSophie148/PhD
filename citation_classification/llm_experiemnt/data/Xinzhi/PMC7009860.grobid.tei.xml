<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Interpretation of the Terms of Reference</head><p><s>Witches' broom (MLO) is one of a number of pests listed in the appendices to the Terms of Reference (ToR) to be subject to pest categorisation to determine whether it fulfils the criteria of a quarantine pest or those of a Union regulated non-quarantine pest (RNQP) for the area of the European Union (EU), excluding Ceuta, Melilla and the outermost regions of Member States (MSs) referred to in Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), other than Madeira and the Azores.</s></p><p><s>'Witches' broom' is an unclear term as it is not the name of a particular disease, but it describes symptoms that can be attributed to many different pests.</s><s>Directive 2000/29/EC considers Witches' broom (MLO) only on 'plants of Citrus L., Fortunella Swingle, Poncirus Raf., and their hybrids, other than fruit and seeds', and therefore, for the purpose of this pest categorisation, the PLH Panel considers only the phytoplasma strains that cause witches' broom symptoms on Citrus aurantifolia.</s><s>The causal agent, which is now known to be a phytoplasma, corresponds to the Witches' broom disease of lime (WBDL) phytoplasma.</s><s>From here on the PLH Panel will refer to this as WBDL phytoplasma.</s><s>This is one specific strain within the 'Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia' species.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Literature search</head><p><s>A literature search on Witches' broom (MLO) was conducted at the beginning of the categorisation in the ISI Web of Science bibliographic database, using the scientific name of the pest (Witches' broom disease of lime phytoplasma and 'Candidatus phytoplasma aurantifolia') as search terms.</s><s>Relevant papers were reviewed, and further references and information were obtained from experts, from citations within the references and grey literature.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Database search</head><p><s>Pest information, on host(s) and distribution, was retrieved from the EPPO Global Database (EPPO, 2017).</s><s>Data about import of commodity types that could potentially provide a pathway for the pest to enter the EU and about the area of hosts grown in the EU were obtained from EUROSTAT.</s></p><p><s>The Europhyt database was consulted for pest-specific notifications on interceptions and outbreaks.</s><s>Europhyt is a web-based network launched by the Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) and is a subproject of PHYSAN (Phyto-Sanitary Controls) specifically concerned with plant health information.</s><s>The Europhyt database manages notifications of interceptions of plants or plant products that do not comply with EU legislation as well as notifications of plant pests detected in the territory of the MSs and the phytosanitary measures taken to eradicate or avoid their spread.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Methodologies</head><p><s>The Panel performed the pest categorisation for Witches' broom (MLO), following guiding principles and steps presented in the EFSA guidance on the harmonised framework for pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2010) and as defined in the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(FAO, 2013)</ref> and No 21 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(FAO, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In accordance with the guidance on a harmonised framework for pest risk assessment in the EU (EFSA PLH Panel, 2010), this work was initiated following an evaluation of the EU's plant health regime.</s><s>Therefore, to facilitate the decision-making process, in the conclusions of the pest categorisation, the Panel addresses explicitly each criterion for a Union quarantine pest and for a Union RNQP in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 on protective measures against pests of plants and includes additional information required as per the specific ToR received by the European Commission.</s><s>In addition, for each conclusion, the Panel provides a short description of its associated uncertainty.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> presents the Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 pest categorisation criteria on which the Panel bases its conclusions.</s><s>All relevant criteria have to be met for the pest to potentially qualify either as a quarantine pest or as a RNQP.</s><s>If one of the criteria is not met, the pest will not qualify.</s><s>Note that a pest that does not qualify as a quarantine pest may still qualify as a RNQP which needs to be addressed in the opinion.</s><s>For the pests regulated in the protected zones only, the scope of the categorisation is the territory of the protected zone; thus, the criteria refer to the protected zone instead of the EU territory.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that the Panel's conclusions are formulated respecting its remit and particularly with regard to the principle of separation between risk assessment and risk management (EFSA founding regulation (EU) No 178/2002); therefore, instead of determining whether the pest is likely to have an unacceptable impact, the Panel will present a summary of the observed pest impacts.</s><s>Economic impacts are expressed in terms of yield and quality losses and not in monetary terms, while addressing social impacts is outside the remit of the Panel, in agreement with EFSA guidance on a harmonised framework for pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2010).</s><s>The Panel will not indicate in its conclusions of the pest categorisation whether to continue the risk assessment process, but, following the agreed two-step approach, will continue only if requested by the risk managers.</s><s>However, during the categorisation process, experts may identify key elements and knowledge gaps that could contribute significant uncertainty to a future assessment of risk.</s><s>It would be useful to identify and highlight such gaps so that potential future requests can specifically target the major elements of uncertainty, perhaps suggesting specific scenarios to examine.</s></p><p><s>Criterion of pest categorisation Criterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding Union quarantine pest Criterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding protected zone quarantine pest (articles 32-35) Criterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding Union regulated non-quarantine pest Regulatory status (Section 3.3) If the pest is present in the EU but not widely distributed in the risk assessment area, it should be under official control or expected to be under official control in the near future.</s><s>The protected zone system aligns with the pest-free area system under the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).</s><s>The pest satisfies the IPPC definition of a quarantine pest that is not present in the risk assessment area (i.e.</s><s>protected zone).</s><s>Is the pest regulated as a quarantine pest?</s><s>If currently regulated as a quarantine pest, are there grounds to consider its status could be revoked?</s><s>Pest potential for entry, establishment and spread in the EU territory (Section 3.4) Is the pest able to enter into, become established in and spread within the EU territory?</s><s>If yes, briefly list the pathways.</s><s>Is the pest able to enter into, become established in and spread within the protected zone areas?</s><s>Is entry by natural spread from EU areas where the pest is present possible?</s><s>Is spread mainly via specific plants for planting rather than via natural spread or via movement of plant products or other objects?</s><s>Clearly state if plants for planting is the main pathway Potential for consequences in the EU territory (Section 3.5) Would the pests' introduction have an economic or environmental impact on the EU territory?</s><s>Would the pests' introduction have an economic or environmental impact on the protected zone areas?</s><s>Does the presence of the pest on plants for planting have an economic impact, as regards the intended use of those plants for planting?</s><s>Available measures (Section 3.6) Are there measures available to prevent the entry into, establishment within or spread of the pest within the EU such that the risk becomes mitigated?</s></p><p><s>Are there measures available to prevent the entry into, establishment within or spread of the pest within the protected zone areas such that the risk becomes mitigated?</s><s>Is it possible to eradicate the pest in a restricted area within 24 months (or a period longer than 24 months where the biology of the organism so justifies) after the presence of the pest was confirmed in the protected zone?</s><s>Are there measures available to prevent pest presence on plants for planting such that the risk becomes mitigated?</s></p></div>
