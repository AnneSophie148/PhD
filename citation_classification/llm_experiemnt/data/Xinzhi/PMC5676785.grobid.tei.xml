Striatellus populations, while Ban et  al. (2012) reported chlorpyrifos RRs of 10-61.8 with 11 (out of 13) L. Striatellus populations having RRs &gt; 22 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>This apparent increase in chlorpyrifos susceptibility could be a consequence of the reduced use of chlorpyrifos, which is being rotated with other insecticides, such as thiamethoxam and pymetrozine, to slow down resistance development in field populations.</s><s>Pymetrozine is a new insecticide with a novel mode of action against sucking insects such as the planthopper.</s><s>Previous results found that L. Striatellus was susceptible or had a low level of resistance to pymetrozine (RR = 0.5-6.7) in 18 field populations tested between 2010 and 2013 in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Pymetrozine use has been increasing among Chinese farmers with government subsidy in recent years, and we found that field L. striatellus had developed a moderate level of resistance to pymetrozine (RR of 18.7-34.5).</s><s>This result suggests that pymetrozine has been overused, and action is required to slow down the development of resistance.</s></p><p><s>Buprofezin is an insect growth regulator and has a long history of use in planthopper control.</s><s>High levels of buprofezin resistance have developed in several pest species <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The current study showed that L. striatellus in eastern China has developed an alarmingly high resistance level to buprofezin with high RR (108.8-156.1),</s><s>but in the northeast Changchun population, only moderate resistance to buprofezin with an RR of 26.6 is present.</s><s>This finding suggests that buprofezin use should be limited in eastern China by rotation with other insecticides.</s><s>Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide that has been used for planthopper control in rice since the 1990s, and no apparent small brown planthopper resistance to thiamethoxam was observed in this study, in line with Ban et al.
