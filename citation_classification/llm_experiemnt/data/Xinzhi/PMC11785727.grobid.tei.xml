growers use various methods including insecticide sprays, biological control, and sanitation practices.</s><s>However, these methods are becoming increasingly ineffective against D. suzukii due to increased resistance against insecticides and increasing labor costs.</s><s>Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been used successfully to control many agricultural pests, but the use of irradiation, sex sorting, and the requirement to scale these insects make it costly to implement.</s><s>pgSIT (precision guided Sterile Insect Technique) is a novel and efficient way to generate sterile males through genetic engineering and overcomes the drawbacks of traditional SIT.</s><s>pgSIT has been implemented in multiple Dipteran insects, including D. suzukii, and has been shown to suppress wild insect populations.</s><s>To further characterize sterile pgSIT males, we evaluated their fertility capacity, lack of mature sperm, and ability to induce a mating refractory period in D. suzukii wildtype females.</s><s>In this study, we found that pgSIT sterile males do not produce mature sperm and can induce a refractory mating period in wildtype females.</s><s>Furthermore, sperm DNA is not detected in the reproductive tracts of pgSIT-mated female reproductive tracts.</s><s>These findings further support the penetrance of the pgSIT technology in D. suzukii and provide further supporting data to governing regulatory bodies in their evaluation of this technology.</s></p><p><s>Spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii, SWD) is a significant invasive species, originating from eastern and southeastern Asia 1 .</s><s>It was first spotted in North America and Europe in the late 2000s and their geographic spread has only increased 1,2 .</s><s>D. suzukii, unlike other Drosophila species, are considered crop pests due to their attraction to fresh fruits rather than overripe, rotting fruits 2 .</s><s>Many soft-skinned agricultural crops such as strawberries, cherries, and raspberries are affected by D. suzukii females equipped with large, serrated ovipositors which enable them to lay eggs in the fresh fruits 1,2 .</s><s>This allows the eggs to develop into larvae which feed on the fruits, causing them to become damaged 1,2 .</s><s>The fruit penetrating ovipositor can also lead the punctured fruits to be more susceptible to other insects, fungi, and bacteria 3 .</s><s>These damaged fruits result in decreased crop yields and economic loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Management of this pest is key to addressing the economic losses growers face.</s><s>Often, a combined approach using different strategies, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), is deployed.</s><s>Common IPM approaches include cultural practices (i.e.</s><s>pruning, mass trapping, fruit removal and sanitation), biological practices (i.e.</s><s>nematodes, microorganisms, parasitoids), and chemical practices (conventional and organic insecticides) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Despite all these practices, growers rely on synthetic chemicals to reduce SWD populations.</s><s>Although very effective at killing SWD, insecticides are broad spectrum and affect non-target insects including pollinators.</s><s>Growers are faced with using multiple spray applications to combat this pest, but insecticide resistance develops after repeated exposure 6,7 .</s><s>Coupled with the high reproductive rates and short generation time of SWD, evolution against insecticides arises rapidly.</s><s>Growers are now moving towards using more environmentally friendly practices due to the increasing demands for cleaner environments and safe food.</s><s>Therefore, growers need novel and effective tools for managing SWD.</s></p><p><s>The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an effective pest control tool which relies on the use of sterile insects for the management or suppression of target insect pests.</s><s>SIT has been used for over 70 years and it is responsible for successful eradication programs of some agricultural pests including the screw-worm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax) 8 , Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) 9 , tsetse fly (Glossina austeni) 10 , and the Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens) 11 .</s><s>Implementing SIT requires mass rearing of the target insect, sex-sorting, and complete sterilization by irradiation 12 .</s><s>The levels of radiation must be high enough to sterilize the insect, but not severely impact survival and ability to mate <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>pgSIT is a powerful technology that utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 technology to precisely sterilize insect males for insect population control <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> .</s><s>This technology is of critical importance in the agricultural industry as part of a grower's goal to reduce the usage of synthetic chemicals for pest control.</s></p><p><s>Agragene has developed an improved form of pgSIT in D. suzukii and seeks to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct field trials and ultimately commercialize this product in the US.</s><s>As a biopesticidal product which is derived from a well-known plant pest (SWD), both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) have shared regulatory oversight governing the movement, confined testing, distribution and environmental release of this product.</s><s>This shared jurisdiction and oversight of this unique biocontrol product was recently described as part of the White House's efforts to update, streamline, and clarify their regulations and oversight for biotechnology products <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref> .</s><s>In particular, the USDA's role is to ensure that the novel modified fly does not present a 'plant pest risk' while the USEPA's focus is to ensure that the pesticidal product will not cause "unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment".</s><s>Moreover, the EPA has been granted authority to set tolerances for these products which further ensures there is a "reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide residue.</s><s>" To register and commercialize a biopesticide, the EPA and USDA must complete comprehensive and rigorous assessments of   the product by utilizing existing and newly generated data-for example, toxicology studies, in vitro digestibility studies, non-target organism evaluations, persistence studies, and physicochemical measurements-as well as information from the literature.</s><s>Additional (or less) information may also need to be submitted to the various agencies for a given product based on the modified fly's unique risk profile and related characteristics.</s><s>Lastly, it is of paramount importance to fully assess and demonstrate the efficacy of the product through a series of confined and open release evaluations in the field as part of the product development process.</s></p><p><s>To conduct field trials and obtain commercial registration in the U.S., regulatory approval must be granted from U.S. regulatory agencies including the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA).</s><s>Fully characterizing the modified flies and ensuring there is complete penetrance of the desired sterility trait amongst released pgSIT males is critical to evaluating efficacy and ensuring release of these novel flies does not present a environmental safety concern.</s><s>Therefore, in this study, we sought to understand the sterility phenotype of the pgSIT sterile males in SWD for SWD pest control.</s><s>The efficacy of pgSIT depends on the penetrance of the male sterility and female lethality phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with previous pgSIT work in Drosophilds and mosquitoes, our study demonstrated 100% male sterility in pgSIT SWD males and complete female lethality in the F1 offspring of gRNA sxl, βtub and vasCas9 parents.</s><s>When examined independently, the breeding lines have comparable fertility to wildtype flies, suggesting no fitness cost is incurred in fertility in the breeding lines.</s><s>This will allow for rapid expansion of the breeding lines for pgSIT sterile male production.</s><s>In addition to confirming the sterility penetrance, we found that the pgSIT sterile males can induce a refractory mating period in their wildtype mates.</s><s>Insect females can undergo a refractory mating period where they do not mate again for a period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> .</s><s>The efficacy of pest control using SIT methods depend on the sexual competitiveness of the mass-reared males.</s><s>Since pgSIT is a novel version of SIT, the in-field efficacy of this technology will also depend on the sexual competitiveness of the gene edited sterile males.</s><s>Understanding whether the mated female undergoes a period of no mating after the initial mating (refractory mating period) is an important consideration for SIT programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27</ref> .</s><s>The refractory mating period induced by pgSIT SWD males suggests that these males can induce these normal mating behaviors in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> .</s><s>Our data clearly demonstrates a delay in the number of offspring produced when wildtype females initially mate with sterile pgSIT males (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, a downward trend in the production of offspring is seen in wildtype females (initially mated with wildtype males) as they mate with the pgSIT sterile males throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>This data can be used to inform on release frequency to achieve maximum efficacy in the field.</s></p><p><s>An examination of dissected ovaries from mated females did not yield any obvious differences amongst the treatments.</s><s>In preliminary dissections (data not shown here), ovaries dissected five days post mating with pgSIT males resulted in large bundles of oocytes.</s><s>We hypothesized that these females were undergoing the hormonal and physiological changes post-mating <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30</ref> .</s><s>However, in the current study we were unable to see these postmating characteristics in the dissected oocytes.</s><s>This could be due to the timing of dissections.</s><s>It is likely the mated females laid eggs before the dissections occurred and thus appeared to have less oocytes bundled in each ovary.</s><s>Indeed, we did detect more mature oocytes in the samples from females mated to vasCas9 and gRNA sxl, βtub males compared to the pgSIT mated female ovaries.</s><s>This likely suggest fertile males were able to transfer sperm and induce egg production in mated females.</s><s>In the virgin dissections, oocytes were present in the ovaries despite the lack of males in this treatment.</s><s>It is well known that virgin Drosophila melanogaster females will lay a small number of unfertilized eggs and represents the initial prerequisite for the evolution of parthenogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31</ref> .</s><s>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the wildtype ovaries from the pgSIT 5-day post mating treatment seem to have an oocyte in the oviduct (ovulation), suggesting the female was preparing to lay this egg immediately before dissections occurred.</s><s>Furthermore, in the reproductive tracts of mated females, we were able to detect the genetic material passed on from the vasCas9 males and not in the tracts of females that mated with pgSIT males using vasCas9-specific primers.</s><s>If genetic material was indeed transferred from pgSIT males to females, detection of the vasCas9specific amplicon would appear after PCR.</s><s>The absence of the vasCas9 amplicon coincides with the lack of mature sperm in the testis of pgSIT sterile males (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>In the gRNA sxl, βtub mating, however, we were unable to obtain a signal (PCR amplicon using gRNA sxl, βtub -specific primers) in the DNA extracts of the reproductive tracts of wildtype females.</s><s>We wonder if the gRNA sxl, βtub sperm transferred was sufficient to fertilize oocytes, but below the limit of detection.</s><s>Although we would have liked to have detected the gRNA sxl, βtub amplicon for further evidence of our ability to detect transferred genetic material, the vasCas9 PCR detection proved sufficient.</s></p><p><s>The work detailed in this study expands on the unique characteristic of the pgSIT technology: no genetic material is transferred during mating.</s><s>Other novel insect biocontrol technologies such as the Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal (RIDL), Wolbachia-infected insects, and gene drives have been proposed to combat insect pests.</s><s>However, for these technologies to induce population suppression, they require the transfer of genetic material from the released male insect <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> .</s><s>pgSIT has the advantages associated with genetically engineered insects without the risk of persisting and propagating in the environment.</s><s>Before pgSIT can be widely used on the commercial scale, it must undergo rigorous evaluation by stakeholders, US-EPA, and USDA.</s><s>Some biotechnologies, like RIDL and Wolbachia-based technologies, are further along in the regulatory approval process in some states as experimental use permits (EUP) for broad scale trials have been issued <ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the release of irradiated sterile males (SIT) are not regulated by the U.S., despite the random DNA changes/mutations through DNA damage is caused by radiation <ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36</ref> .</s><s>We hope that this study provides additional evidence of the sterility phenotype penetrance, precise gene edits at target genes and the lack of genetic persistence and propagation in pgSIT sterile males.</s><s>pgSIT is a powerful and precise tool that can be implemented in the grower's IPM toolbox for insect pest control.</s></p></div>
