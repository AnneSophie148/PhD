in addition, aphids vector many plant viruses.</s><s>Genetic control of aphids through plant resistance (R) genes is a common pest management tool in many crops.</s><s>Breeding programs cross such monogenic aphid resistance genes into plant germplasm and ensure resistance is retained in new plant varieties through marker-assisted selection.</s><s>Despite their utility, only two aphid resistance genes have been isolated and characterized: Mi-1 from tomato, conferring resistance to the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae;

(2012)</ref> identified a QTL on chromosome 3, separate from both AIN and AKR, that accounted for 33% in the relative reduction of plant biomass in response to BGA in an A17×A20 recombinant inbred line population.</s><s>Whether this locus interacts with AIN-generated ROS in the same fashion to lead to the reduction in plant biomass remains to be determined.</s><s>What is clear is that the addition of AKR to the AIN background may create a much stronger resistance; this enhancement may operate, in part, through a more optimal modulation of ROS homeostasis in aphid-infested leaves.</s><s>ROS are increasingly recognized for their central role in linking environmental stimuli with plant metabolism, including roles in long-distance signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Waszczak et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>In this regard, it is notable that AKRmediated resistance to BGA was shown to be systemically induced by prior infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Klingler et al., 2005)</ref>, although other systemic signals (including JA-related compounds) may be involved.</s><s>The production of H 2 O 2 in response to BGA, and the genetic interactions underlying the growth of necrotic lesions in the AIN background, coupled with the many genetic and genomic resources in the model legume M. trucatula, suggest that this system could offer agriculturally relevant clues to ROS biology.</s></p><p><s>The M. truncatula accessions Mogul and Caliph also possess AKR, and both appear to lack AIN since no macroscopic necrotic lesions or small chlorotic lesions are observed in these accessions, whereas their near-isogenic partners Borung and Cyprus, respectively, lack AKR <ref type="bibr">(Gao et al., 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klingler et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The use of these additional two pairs of nearisogenic lines with different genetic backgrounds could shed more light on the molecular events that mediate aphid resistance by AKR and the influence the presence of AIN has on AKR activity.</s><s>The M. truncatula-BGA interaction offers the advantage of a genome sequence available for both the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Young et al., 2011)</ref> and the pea aphid (IAGC, 2010), a congener of BGA, and future endeavors should offer new insights to how plant R genes and the HR mediate resistance against insects.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>.</s><s>Overview of the two-sample t-test P-values for each mean value EPG signal derived from individuals of the four haplotypes of AKR and AIN (a minimum of 12 biological repeats with at least three different lines resulting from the Jester×A20 crosses).</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>.</s><s>Overview of gene identifiers and qPCR primer sequences of genes in the M. truncatula genome involved in H 2 O 2 metabolism.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Chromosome 3 haplotypes of M. truncatula lines tested for BGA resistance.</s><s>The positions of the AKR and AIN loci are indicated on each chromosome.</s><s>The shading in the Jester chromosome indicates the region of introgression into the A17 genetic background, based on DNA polymorphism analysis.</s><s>The hatched pattern in the A20 chromosome indicates a haplotype genetically distinct from the reference genotype A17 (chromosome shown in white) and from Jester.</s><s>Jester×A20 F 2 plants with recombination events between the AKR and AIN loci were used to generate experimental lines with different homozygous combinations of the two loci.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,88.28,434.40,433.44,241.71" type="bitmap" /></figure>
