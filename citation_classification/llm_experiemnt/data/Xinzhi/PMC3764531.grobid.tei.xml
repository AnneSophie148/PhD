studies of biodiversity of aphids.</s><s>During these studies, they proved to be a good method, giving valid results.</s><s>Shannon-Weaver diversity index is not an absolute indicator of the diversity of a certain area, it is used to compare different localities or the same locality in different years or weeks of a year.</s><s>For this purpose it was used in these researches.</s></p><p><s>The values of Shannon-Weaver diversity index varied during the growing season.</s><s>Temperature changes and rain influence the abundance of aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Morgan 2000)</ref>, which also results in changes in the values of this index.</s><s>However, in most localities the highest values were recorded in the first half of the monitored period, i.e. in spring.</s><s>The total values of the index were similar among different sites, regardless of altitude.</s><s>Due to the fact that Shannon-Weaver index takes into account the number of species and frequency of each species' individuals, localities with large differences in the number of aphids had similar index values.</s><s>The highest values were recorded in locality Begeč, at an altitude of 80 m.</s><s>Morisita-Horn index takes into account the diversity of species and number of individuals, and it showed that there are not large differences between different localities, i.e. different localities have similar richness of the species.</s><s>Locality Zablaće was clearly separated from other localities because of the five species which were recorded only in this locality during investigations.</s></p><p><s>In spite of similar values of Shannon-Weaver diversity index among different localities, participation of the vectors in it is different.</s><s>The Chi-square analysis showed highly significant difference in vector frequencies among seasons and sites, with more pronounced differences for PVY.</s><s>As a consequence of differences in vector frequencies, the vector pressure index in some regions was different also.</s><s>In areas at lower altitudes such as Begeč, a higher number of vector species was registered, as well as more individuals of each present species.</s><s>M. persicae, the most important vector of viruses was found in most localities, but in high number only in localities Begeč and Kotraža, while at the localities above 1100 m it was registered very rarely and in a low number.</s><s>In localities under 900m, potato sowing is usually done in April, while there is an intensive growth of potato in May when aphid flight is at maximum and virus infection risk is the highest.</s><s>Potato is the most sensitive in the first development phases, until flowering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(DiFonso et al. 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Production of virus free seed potatoes is possible if the pressure of vectors does not exceed the value of 10-15 by the end of June -early July <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Basky 2002)</ref>.</s><s>In localities above 1000m, potato sowing is usually done at the end of May or beginning of Jun, depending on the ambient temperature.</s><s>Except a lower number of aphids at higher altitudes, later sowing leads to avoiding the periods of aphid maximum flight and the risk of virus infection is reduced.</s><s>Also, at higher altitudes, agricultural production is not intensive and the possibilities for isolated production are stronger.</s></p><p><s>Results of these studies show that only in localities at high altitudes, such as mountain Golija, it is possible to grow healthy, virus free seed potato.</s><s>This research indicated that the potential of other mountainous regions of Serbia is also high and that Serbia has the capacity for production of quality seed potato.</s><s>Also, this research may have relevance and application in other neighboring countries, too, because of similar relief, vegetation composition, composition of the fauna of aphids, and the possibility of crop production.</s></p></div><figure
