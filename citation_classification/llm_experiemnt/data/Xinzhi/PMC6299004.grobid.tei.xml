<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Root herbivory leads to elevated monoterpene emission in poplar.</s><s>As part of our ongoing research on volatile-mediated defenses in poplar, we analyzed the volatiles emitted from undamaged and M. melolontha (cockchafer)-damaged roots of P. trichocarpa, a species native to North America, and P. nigra, an indigenous European species.</s><s>Trees were grown in sand-filled pots and a push-pull system was used to collect root volatiles from air pumped through the soil (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Volatile analysis was conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</s><s>Root damage caused by the larvae was monitored after the experiment by measuring the total root biomass.</s><s>For P. trichocarpa, cockchafer herbivory led to a significantly reduced root mass in comparison to undamaged controls (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>For P. nigra, however, we could not observe significant differences, although a slight trend of root biomass reduction in the grub treatments was visible (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Undamaged roots of both poplar species released considerable amounts of monoterpenes, including (-)-α-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-β-pinene, and 1,8-cineole (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Two further monoterpenes, p-cymene and an unidentified compound with a molecular mass of 136, could only be detected in the volatile bouquet of P. trichocarpa.</s><s>Herbivory significantly increased the emission of 1,8-cineole from P. trichocarpa, while (-)-camphene and an unidentified monoterpene were significantly induced in herbivore-damaged roots of P. nigra (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Beside monoterpenes, both species also constitutively emitted the aromatic compounds benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde, however, emission of these compounds was not influenced by the herbivore treatment (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Considering that the plastics pots and the moist sand in the volatile collection system both might adsorb plant-released volatiles, our quantification of constitutive and herbivore-induced root volatiles in P. trichocarpa and P. nigra is likely an underestimation of the total volatile release.</s></p><p><s>To measure the potential accumulation of volatile compounds in the roots, we extracted plant material with hexane and analyzed the extracts using GC-MS.</s><s>While the aromatic volatiles benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde accumulated in root material collected from P. trichocarpa and P. nigra, monoterpenes (camphene) could only be detected in the extracts of P. nigra (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, salicylaldehyde and benzaldehyde showed significantly increased accumulation after cockchafer herbivory, although their emission rates were not influenced by the treatment as already mentioned above (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Identification and characterization of three monoterpene synthases in P. trichocarpa and P. nigra.</s></p><p><s>The recently identified terpene synthase PnTPS1 produces camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene and has been shown to be involved in herbivore-induced monoterpene formation in the leaves of P. nigra <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Another monoterpene synthase, the 1,8-cineole synthase PtTPS13, was reported to be expressed in herbivore-damaged leaves of P. trichocarpa <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Since products of both enzymes were found in the volatile bouquets of herbivore-induced P. trichocarpa and P. nigra roots (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we hypothesized that these or similar enzymes are also involved in the formation of root terpenes.</s><s>To identify potential orthologues of PnTPS1 and PtTPS13 in P. trichocarpa and P. nigra, respectively, we amplified the open reading frames from cDNA made from M. melolontha-damaged root material.</s><s>Amplification and cloning were successful and the resulting genes were designated PtTPS21 (P.</s><s>trichocarpa genome version 3.0 accession, Potri.001G308300) and PnTPS4, respectively, according to the poplar TPS nomenclature initiated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Sequencing of several amplicons revealed another P. trichocarpa gene with 97% nucleotide similarity to PtTPS21 that was designated PtTPS16 (Potri.001G308200).</s><s>A sequence comparison and dendrogram analysis of predicted monoterpene synthase genes in the P. trichocarpa genome showed that PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 were part of a gene cluster comprising four members highly similar to each other (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Heterologous expression of the N-terminal truncated open reading frames of the identified sequences lacking their putative signal peptides and subsequent enzyme assays confirmed monoterpene synthase activity for all tested enzymes.</s><s>As expected, PtTPS21 and PnTPS4 had the same activity as their putative orthologues, PnTPS1 and PtTPS13, respectively, and produced camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene (PtTPS21) and 1,8-cineole and a few minor products (PnTPS4) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, PtTPS16, although highly similar to PtTPS21, showed different product specificity and produced γ-terpinene together with a mixture of minor monoterpene products (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Chiral analysis of PtTPS21 enzyme products showed that all of the produced monoterpenes were exclusively formed as (-)-enantiomers (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>When tested with the sesquiterpene precursor (E,E)-FPP, PnTPS4 showed activity and produced a mixture of sesquiterpens including (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene, (E,E)-α-farnesene, sesquiphellandrene, (Z)-α-bisabolene, and nerolidol (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>However, since PnTPS4 was found to possess a signal peptide that targets the protein to the plastids (Supplementary Fig S4 ), it functions most likely as monoterpene synthase in planta.</s><s>In contrast to PnTPS4, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 were not active with (E,E)-FPP.</s><s>The diterpene substrate (E,E,E)-GGPP was not accepted by the tested enzymes.</s></p><p><s>Homology modeling of PtTPS16 and in vitro mutagenesis of active site residues.</s><s>To identify the amino acid residues that determine the observed differences in product specificity of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, we performed homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of PtTPS16 using the crystal structure of (+)-limonene synthase from Citrus sinensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as a template.</s><s>Visualization of the resulting model and an amino acid sequence comparison of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 revealed four amino acid substitutions within the active site pockets of the two proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>In vitro mutagenesis of the single residues isoleucine 335, valine 441, and valine 483 in PtTPS16 revealed no or only marginal changes in product specificity of the resulting mutant enzymes PtTPS16 I335V, PtTPS16 V441I, and PtTPS16 V483L, while a mutation of threonine 336 to asparagine led to an enzyme able to produce camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene in addition to γ-terpinene (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Different combinations of single amino acid changes finally showed that the quadruple mutant PtTPS16 I335V, T336N, V441I, V483L had a product specificity highly similar to PtTPS21, although there were still minor quantitative differences in the product profiles of the mutant and PtTPS21 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Gene expression analysis of terpene synthases in poplar roots.</s><s>The expression levels of P. trichocarpa PtTPS13, PtTPS16, and PtTPS21 and P. nigra PnTPS4 and PnTPS1 were measured in undamaged and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

consequence of the ongoing evolutionary arms race between plants and their enemies.</s><s>Both, the diverse biological roles of induced volatiles in plant defense as well as the biochemical basis of volatile formation have been intensively investigated in the past.</s><s>However, the majority of this research focused on above-ground volatiles and thus our knowledge about root volatiles is still limited.</s><s>Above-ground volatile blends are often dominated by mono-and sesquiterpenes that can fulfill diverse functions in plant-herbivore interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Here we could show that undamaged and herbivore-damaged roots of the two poplar species P. trichocarpa and P. nigra produce and release a mixture of monoterpenes together with a few aromatic compounds (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>These findings together with previous studies on maize, citrus, oak, and apple <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> indicate that monoterpenes are also common, major components of herbivore-induced root volatile blends.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, although emitted as volatiles, (-)-α-pinene, (-)-β-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole could not be detected in root tissues of the investigated poplar trees.</s><s>This suggests de novo biosynthesis, but also an efficient transport of the terpenes from the site of their formation to the rhizosphere that prevents any detectable accumulation in the plant.</s><s>Root volatile emission without detectable tissue accumulation has also been reported in Arabidopsis, where the 1,8-cineole synthase AtTPS-Cin was found to be exclusively expressed in roots.</s><s>While the enzyme product could not be detected in root extracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , 1,8-cineole is indeed one of the major components of the Arabidopsis root volatile blend <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The 1,8-cineole synthase gene AaTPS in Artemisia annua is also expressed in roots but its product was not found in pentane extracts made from the respective tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Although one cannot exclude a conversion of 1,8-cineole into another product, it is tempting to speculate that A. annua roots emit 1,8-cineole as shown for Populus and Arabidopsis.</s></p><p><s>Beside monoterpenes, poplar roots released considerable amounts of aromatic compounds including salicylaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and benzyl alcohol (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the volatile terpenes that showed no accumulation, the aromatic compounds accumulated in the roots (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>While their emission was not significantly influenced by the treatments, accumulation of salicylaldehyde and benzaldehyde was significantly increased upon herbivory.</s><s>Thus one may hypothesize that both aldehydes are formed as degradation products of preformed salicinoids, a class of Salicaceae-specific phenolic glycosides derived from salicyl alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Or, the formation of these aromatic compounds might be independently induced by herbivory.</s></p><p><s>The 1,8-cineole synthase PtTPS13 and the camphene synthase PnTPS1 from P. trichocarpa and P. nigra, respectively, have recently been shown to be involved in herbivore-induced monoterpene formation in poplar leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Since 1,8-cineole and camphene were also part of the poplar root volatile blend (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we tested the expression of PtTPS13 and PnTPS1 in undamaged and herbivore-damaged roots of P. trichocarpa and P. nigra.</s><s>Moreover, we amplified and characterized the putative orthologues of PtTPS13 and PnTPS1, PnTPS4 and PtTPS21, respectively, and included them into gene expression analysis.</s><s>The qRT-PCR experiment revealed that all analyzed genes were expressed in roots and showed significant induction (PtTPS13, PnTPS4, PnTPS1) or at least a trend for higher expression (PtTPS21) upon herbivory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s><s>With one exception, the gene expression levels matched the emission of the respective major enzyme products, indicating that the terpene synthases contribute to monoterpene formation in P. trichocarpa and P. nigra roots.</s><s>The 1,8-cineole synthase PnTPS4, however, was strongly upregulated upon herbivory, although 1,8-cineole was constitutively released from P. nigra roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s><s>This discrepancy might be explained by a conversion of 1,8-cineol to another terpenoid specifically upon herbivory in P. nigra.</s><s>Interestingly, P. trichocarpa possesses two other TPS genes (Potri.T00100 and Potri.</s><s>T000300) with high similarity to PtTPS13 and PnTPS4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Because amplification of Potri.T00100 and Potri.</s><s>T000300 in P. trichocarpa failed, we speculate

sequence similarity of about 97% to PtTPS21, PtTPS16 had different product specificity and produced mainly γ-terpinene (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>; Fig. <ref

major root volatiles in P. trichocarpa, it is conceivable that P. trichocarpa also metabolizes γ-terpinene into this oxidized monoterpene.</s><s>The absence of p-cymene in P. nigra could likely be explained by the loss of the respective PtTPS16 orthologue or loss of its expression in this species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Terpene synthases catalyze complex reactions, which are usually initiated by the metal ion-mediated cleavage of the diphosphate group from the substrate.</s><s>The resulting carbocation is highly reactive and can undergo a series of

in PtTPS16/21 mainly determines the different product outcome of the two enzymes.</s><s>Notably, the product profiles of the PtTPS16 quadruple mutant and the PtTPS21 wild type were not completely identical but still showed minor quantitative differences.</s><s>It is thus likely that amino acid residue substitutions near the active site also influence the backbone and/or side chain conformation of active site residues and thus contribute to the fine tuning of TPS product specificity.</s><s>Such effects have already been observed in mutagenesis experiments conducted with the
