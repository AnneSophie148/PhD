<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Dickeya dadantii are plant pathogenic enterobacteria that provoke the soft rot disease in a wide range of plants.</s><s>The factors required for its pathogeny are numerous, involving principally the production and the secretion of enzymes responsible for the degradation of plant cell wall components <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Regulation of their expression has been studied in detail.</s><s>The regulators of the virulence factors identified are either specific to D. dadantii and other plant pathogenic enterobacteria, such as KdgR, PecS and PecT, or are identical to those that can be found in animal and human pathogenic enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>These regulators include H-NS, CRP, Fur, GacS-GacA and PhoP-PhoQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>The PhoP-PhoQ two component regulatory system controls virulence and Mg 2+ homeostasis in many bacterial species.</s><s>Its role has been well studied in S. enterica serovar typhimurium.</s><s>In these bacteria, this system is involved in the regulation of Mg 2+ uptake systems, survival in macrophages and resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This resistance occurs through the modification of LPS.</s><s>Several enzymes, encoded by pagP, pagO, pmrC, pmrG, lpxO, pmrHFIJKLM, modify LPS, mostly by adding or modifying palmitate, phosphoethanolamine or 4-aminoarabinose to mask negative charges that allow interaction with cationic AMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Activation of these genes occurs either directly by PhoP-PhoQ or by PmrA-PmrB, a two component system that can be activated by PhoP through PmrD, a protein stabilizing PmrA in a phosphorylated state.</s><s>Thus, the genes controlled by PmrA-B are induced both by the signals activating PmrB (macrophage phagosome, high Fe 3+ , low pH) and those activating PhoQ (low Mg 2+ , antimicrobial peptides, macrophage phagosome, low pH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, the genes regulated by PhoP and the signal sensed by PhoQ may vary from one bacterium to the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>For exemple, Edwarsiella tarda PhoQ is also able to sense temperature, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhoQ does not respond to AMP, and Sodalis glossinidius PhoQ responds neither to Mg 2+ nor to AMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref>].</s><s>An analysis of the transcriptome of a D. dadantii phoQ mutant showed that many genes are controlled by this regulator.</s><s>The increased expression of ferric uptake systems and the decreased expression of pectate lyase genes let suppose that phoQ could control the bacterial virulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Llama-Palacios et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> showed that the D. dadantii phoP and phoQ mutants have a reduced virulence and an increased sensitivity to the plant AMP thionin.</s><s>A transcriptomic analysis of the response of D. dadantii to this AMP found 36 overexpressed genes.</s><s>These induced genes are involved in regulation, transport and modification of the bacterial membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>D. dadantii is not only a plant pathogen but it can also infect animals.</s><s>Presence of four insecticidal toxin-like genes in its genome, cytABCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, led to check for a possible pathogenicity towards different insects.</s><s>It was found able to kill the pea aphid Acyrtosiphon pisum but not other insects tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Ingestion of as few as 100 bacteria can kill the aphid in 3-4 days.</s><s>Bacteria cross the gut and after one day they are present in the gut in high number but also in the fat bodies and in the embryos.</s><s>Their number increases of about one log each day and when it exceedes 10 7 bacteria/insect, the insect dies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>A mutant devoid of Cyt toxin genes is still pathogenic but kills the aphid more slowly, in 5 to 6 days.</s><s>cyt genes are controlled by regulators of plant pathogenicity: they are activated by PecS and repressed by H-NS and VfmE.</s><s>Mutants in other regulators, GacA, OmpR and PhoP, that do not control the cyt genes, have a reduced insect virulence.</s><s>This let suppose that other factors are required for a full virulence to aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, no other known insect toxin gene was detected in the genome of D. dadantii.</s></p><p><s>Very few data are available on the expression pattern of genes of bacteria infecting insects.</s><s>A transcriptome analysis listed the Yersinia pestis genes induced in flea, but Y. pestis colonizes only the flea gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, this study gives a limited pattern of the bacterial response to conditions encountered in insects.</s><s>A SCOTS analysis of Photorhabdus temperata and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi genes expressed in Rhizotrogus majalis identified genes mostly involved in virulence, stress response and metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>A Transposon Site Hybridization assay identified Francisella novicida genes required to infect Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in all these studies, infection was done by injection, which is not the most likely path to infection.</s><s>To identify new factors involved in the virulence of D. dadantii towards A. pisum, we analyzed the transcriptome of D. dadantii infecting the insect.</s><s>We show here that genes involved in resistance to AMP, efflux and motility are among the most induced genes while genes involved in plant pathogeny are repressed.</s><s>Mutation of AMP resistance genes decreased bacterial virulence in insects which is a strong indication that, in contrast with current knowledge, aphids are producing this kind of molecules.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of D. Dadantii Genes with Modified Expression in A. Pisum</head><p><s>In order to identify genes that are important for growth inside the pea aphid and that may be required for virulence, we used CDS pangenomic microarrays to compare the transcriptome of D. dadantii grown in AP3 medium with that of the bacteria isolated from A. pisum three days after infection.</s><s>AP3 medium, which contains a high concentration of sucrose, may mimic the phloemic sap on which aphids feed.</s><s>Day three post infection was chosen as a stage where infection is well established.</s><s>At this stage, aphids may contain up to 10 6 bacteria which are present in all the insect organs.</s><s>For each condition, three independent cultures or infections were performed and the total bacterial RNA was extracted, treated and subsequently hybridized to separate arrays.</s><s>Major modifications of the transcription pattern were observed since 164 genes were upregulated more than 5-fold and 328 genes were downregulated more than 5-fold with P values adjusted for multiple testing (FDR) of ,0.002.</s><s>The whole-genome GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) analysis is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>, and shows that the most affected bacterial gene classes by the insect infection process were membrane associated genes (GO cell compartment), both in up or down-regulated classes, RNA and ribosomal machinery genes, as well as many enzyme and sugar transporters (GO molecular function) and finally additional classes such as protein secretion, several biosynthetic processes, cell redox homeostasis and many central metabolic processes (GO biological processes).</s><s>A list of selected induced or repressed genes that are discussed in the text is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (for the full list, see Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>The gene expression pattern obtained by microarray data results was confirmed by qRT-PCR on nine genes.</s><s>Six up regulated (arnB, sotA, sotB, pmrC, GenID 19611 and GenID 15786) and three down regulated genes (pelE, kdgM and kdgN) were tested and gave a strong correlation with microarray results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant Virulence Genes are Repressed in Aphids</head><p><s>Our previous results showed that the regulators controlling cyt genes are identical to those regulating plant virulence factors, but that they act in an opposite way <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The microarray analysis confirms these observations on a wider basis since many genes involved in pectin degradation, which are induced in plant infection, are repressed.</s><s>The genes of the two oligogalacturonatespecific porins <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> are among the most repressed (kdgM, -92fold change; kdgN, 255-fold change).</s><s>Genes of some secreted enzymes involved in pectin degradation were also down regulated (pelE, paeX, pehN) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), as were genes involved in the transport and catabolism of pectin breakdown products (exuT, uxaB, uxaA, kduD, kdgA).</s><s>The complete catabolic pathway of galactan, another component of plant cell walls, is also strongly repressed (252-fold change for the gene of the porin GanL).</s><s>Expression of the Out type II secretion system (T2SS), that secretes mostly pectinases is also reduced (outC, 26.5-fold change).</s><s>In contrast, expression of the second T2SS, Stt, which secretes the pectin lyase PnlH is slightly increased (sttI, 5.3-fold change).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Dadantii Genes Induced in Aphids</head><p><s>The most induced genes in this transcriptome analysis probably correspond to those which are the most needed to infect and survive in aphids.</s><s>It is remarkable to note that many of these genes encode exporters (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>GenID 15786-7-8, with 68-, 48-and 64-fold change, respectively, encode a tripartite multidrug resistance system whose best homologues are found in plant pathogenic or plant-associated bacteria (Pseudomonas sp., Xanthomonas sp.) and also in insect pathogens (P.</s><s>entomophila, Arsenophonus nasoniae) or some insect symbionts (Baumannia cicadellinicola).</s><s>This transporter confers to D. dadantii resistance to phytoalexins and protamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Expression of four genes encoding transporters of the MFS family is also induced: GenID 19611 (37-fold change), GenID 18887 (24-fold change), sotA (14-fold change) and sotB (20fold change).</s><s>If the specificity of the two first exporters is not known, SotA and SotB have been shown to be able to export sugar and sugar derivatives that can be toxic to the bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The gene of the efflux protein PecM is induced 24-fold.</s><s>pecM belongs to the pecS regulon and it has been proposed that it could efflux indigoidine, a blue pigment synthesized by the product of the indABC genes, which also belong to the pecS regulon.</s><s>Surprisingly, the indABC genes are only weekly induced and other pecScontrolled genes are not induced, suggesting that PecM could be controlled by another regulator and efflux other types of molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Induction of all these exporters shows that D. dadantii encounters hostile conditions in aphid and has to efflux many noxious compounds.</s></p><p><s>Expression of motility genes is strongly modified in the aphid.</s><s>D. dadantii possesses 45 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP) which are often organized in clusters.</s><s>Expression of some of these genes was increased.</s><s>For example, in the four MCP gene cluster GenID 19858-GenID 19855-GenID 19852-Gen ID19851, expression of the two first increased 43-fold and 30-fold respectively, while that of the two last genes was unmodified (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Similarly, in the four MCP gene cluster GenID 17665-GenID 17668-GenID 17672-GenID 17674, expression of the three first genes increased 7-fold to 8-fold, while that of the last gene was unmodified.</s><s>Expression of the genes of two components of the flagellar motor MotA and MotB increased 15-fold and 11-fold, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Colonization of the insect body occurs very quickly, within one day after infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Induction of these MCP and motility proteins could help the bacteria to quickly reach all the part of the insect body.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Osmotic Regulation of Cyt Toxin Genes</head><p><s>We have shown that the Cyt toxins are required only for infection by ingestion and that they can be detected in the gut but not in other organs, suggesting that they are not produced throughout all the infection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, their synthesis is induced in high osmolarity environment.</s><s>These observations explain why cyt gene expression is surprisingly diminished in our results (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For the reference condition, bacteria were grown in the sucrose rich (20%) AP3 medium which strongly induces cyt gene expression.</s><s>Bacteria collected in the aphids reside mainly outside of the gut, in the fat body or other organs of the insect in which osmolarity is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>This difference of osmolarity between the two conditions could explain why cyt genes are globally less expressed in the aphids in our experiment.</s><s>This is also the reason why some of the most repressed genes in this analysis are those involved in sucrose transport and metabolism such as the sucrose porin gene scrY (-53-fold change), or in osmoprotectant synthesis and transport (betA, -52-fold change and proX, -23-fold change) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We thus checked whether the strong induction or repression observed for certain genes could result from an osmotic regulation.</s><s>arnB and dltB expression (see below) were repressed only three-fold and 1.3-fold respectively by growth in 10% sucrose (data not shown).</s><s>kdgM and kdgN expression is not regulated by osmolarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, osmoregulation seems to control only a limited subset of the genes induced or repressed in our transcriptomic analysis.</s></p></div>
