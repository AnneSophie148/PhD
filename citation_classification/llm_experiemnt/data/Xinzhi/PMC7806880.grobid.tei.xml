samples containing either nuclease-free water or dsRNA was added to the 1.0 mL artificial diet for a final concentration of 400 ng/Î¼L.</s><s>Seventy microliters of the artificial diet with either dsTPS, dsTRE, or dsGFP were sandwiched between two layers of the parafilm membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Fifteen 3-day-old aphids were introduced into one vial with a fine paintbrush.</s><s>Then, another vial with the diet sandwich was closed with the aphid containing vial by a piece of sterilized gauze.</s><s>The control group was only fed with the artificial diet without dsRNA.</s><s>The artificial diet was replaced every other day to prevent dsRNA degradation.</s><s>After 4 days, all surviving morphs from each treatment were selected and divided randomly into three replicates groups, and then transferred to fresh bean leaf discs.</s><s>The collections were done at 24 h and 48 h after feeding on plant to alleviate the adverse effects of the artificial diet on treated aphids and allow the aphids to adapt feeding on the plants.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that RNAi effects can be remained from the parents subjected to RNAi in their progenies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> .</s><s>Abdellater et al. found that RNAi had a prolonged impact and remained significantly effective in the six subsequent generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60</ref> .</s><s>Mutti et al. also found that Coo2 (Salivary gland transcript) expression dropped dramatically in 3 days after injection with dsRNA <ref type="bibr"

became adults and began to produce young nymphs.</s><s>Three replicates were set for each treatment.</s></p><p><s>Trehalase activity assay.</s><s>Insects were subjected to soluble and membrane-bound trehalase activity analyses at 24 h and 48 h after the 4-day RNAi treatment.</s><s>Trehalase activity was assayed according to the method described by Shen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , with some modifications.</s><s>Briefly, ten aphids were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 130 mM NaCl; 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 â¢2H 2 O; 3 mM NaH 2 PO 4 â¢2H 2 O; pH 7.0), then centrifuged at 1000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 â.</s><s>Subsequently, 450 Î¼L of the supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 â.</s><s>After superspeed centrifugation, the supernatant was directly used to determine the soluble TRE activity and protein content, while the sediment was re-suspended in PBS to evaluate the membrane-bound TRE activity and protein content.</s><s>The measurement of trehalase activities was based on the rate of glucose released from trehalose.</s><s>Either the supernatant (TRE1 activity) or the suspension (TRE2 activity) obtained from ultracentrifugation (70 Î¼L) was uniformly mixed with 40 Î¼L of 40 mM trehalose (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and 180 Î¼L of PBS.</s><s>The mixture was then incubated at 37 â for 60 min and centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4â.</s><s>The resulting supernatant (20 Î¼L) was used to determine the TRE1 and TRE2 activities using the glucose assay kit (Solarbio Biochemical Assay Division, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols.</s><s>The protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction.</s><s>Three replicates were set for each RNAi treatment and the control.</s></p></div>
