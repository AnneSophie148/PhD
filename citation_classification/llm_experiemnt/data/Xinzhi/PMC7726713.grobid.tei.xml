<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study site</head><p><s>Experiments were carried out in an artificial black walnut plantation, with more than half of the trees in an advanced state of decline and exhibiting symptoms typical of TCD: generalized dieback with canopy transparency; leaf yellowing and withering; flag-like brown leaf wilting; and, most importantly, WTB galleries (identified by size-compatible emergence holes) and GM cankers (necrotized areas around holes over the branches and the stems).</s><s>The area (43 °46 N, 11 °24 E, about 115 m above sea level) has a 1.5 Ha extension, with 281 trees, 90% black walnuts (253 trees) and 10% English walnuts (28 trees).</s><s>The English walnut trees were apparently asymptomatic and unaffected by TCD.</s><s>Trees were about 25 years old with diameters (at 1.30 m from the base) ranging between 15 and 35 cm.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling</head><p><s>-WTB: random collecting of dead branches with a long-reach pruner, looking for WTB infested tissues.</s><s>Samples were checked for the presence of WTB emergence holes on the bark, as well as for galleries under the bark by peeling a small portion of the branch with a knife ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ).</s><s>30 sections of infested branches (40 cm long) were placed in a plastic bag and transferred to the laboratory for further examination.</s><s>-GM: to sample the fungus, the walnut plantation was divided into four plots, roughly same-sized, based on the four compass points.</s><s>From each plot, small (roughly 30-50 cm-long), asymptomatic branches of walnut trees were collected, as well as same-dimension branches with visible beetle entry/exit holes (in some galleries the typical whitish mycelium was visible).</s><s>The material taken from each tree was placed in polyethylene bags; each tree from which the sample had been taken was labelled, and the same number/code was marked on the sampling bag.</s><s>This material was then taken to the laboratory for mycological examination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WTB trap monitoring</head><p><s>Two black plastic funnel traps (eight-unit Lindgren multiple funnel traps -Contech Enterprises Inc., Victoria, BC, Canada) baited with a WTB-specific lure (Alpha Scents Inc., Portland, OR) were placed on the symptomatic black walnut plantation during the first week of April 2018.</s><s>The top of the trap was hung on low branches (about two meters high) and a transverse shaft was tied between the lower part of the trap and the tree trunk so that the trap would remain in place even in high wind conditions ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>To prevent non-target catches, as well as collection of debris, a 5-mm, metal wire mesh screen was applied low in the bottom funnel of each trap as in Martin et al .</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</s><s>The wire mesh was glued inside the funnel by applying four diametrically opposed points of hot glue.</s><s>The WTB lure consisted of a dispenser which, once peeled open, released a synthetic aggregation pheromone specific to WTB.</s><s>Dispensers were tied inside the middle funnel and replaced monthly according to manufacturer's instructions.</s><s>According to Seybold et al .'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , the collecting jar was filled with a solution of 30% propylene glycol to allow the prompt killing of catches and their preservation between trap checks; the solution was obtained by adding seven parts of distilled water to pure food-grade propylene glycol.</s></p><p><s>Traps were inspected every 15 days.</s><s>During inspection, all debris, mainly fallen foliage, was shaken and then removed from the bottom funnel before detaching the collecting jar.</s><s>This allowed any remaining beetle to fall past the mesh and into the collecting jar.</s><s>Then, the jar was unscrewed, and its contents poured into a bottle through a cone paper filter with a fine nylon mesh tip (the kind used for straining car paint or car oil), thus quickly discarding the propylene glycol without losing any beetle specimens.</s><s>The process was repeated two more times, to rinse the jar thoroughly and to ensure all the WTB specimens were collected, before discarding the propylene glycol.</s><s>The filter was then folded two times and stored inside a labelled plastic bag, before specimens were transferred to 70% ethanol.</s><s>The number of WTB specimens captured at each inspection date is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> .</s></p></div>
