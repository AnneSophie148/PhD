<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Midguts from CLas-exposed insects show abnormalities in gross morphology and nuclear architecture, including pyknosis and karyorrhexis.</head><p><s>In the midguts from CLas-exposed ACP, we observed abnormal continuity of the midgut diameter as compared to guts from insects reared on healthy trees.</s><s>We observed the formation of dark necrotic portions and necrotic spots that were not observed in guts from pysllids reared on healthy trees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>To study the nature of the necrotic phenotypes in more detail, we stained guts dissected from CLas-exposed or non-exposed adult insects with DAPI to observe nuclear structures and overall gut cell morphology.</s><s>In midguts from CLas-exposed psyllids, DAPI stained nuclei showed clear evidence of pyknosis, that is the shrinkage of the nucleus due to irreversible chromatin condensation (Figs 1, 2 and 3).</s><s>The majority of the pyknotic nuclei had lost their normal elliptical structure (Figs 1, 2 and 3).</s><s>Other nuclei showed evidence of karyorrhexis, which is the fragmentation of the nucleus with the irregular distribution of chromatin throughout the cell.</s><s>Many irregularly shaped and spaced punctate regions of chromatin were observed outside of the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Nuclei from psyllids reared on healthy trees appeared regularly dispersed in the cells and of uniform shape, size and DAPI staining efficiency.</s><s>Quantification of this effect showed that nuclei fragmentation in the midguts was observed in ~65% of the CLas-exposed adult psyllids reared on CLas-infected plants, but only in 12% of adult ACPs reared on healthy trees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Notably, some of the abnormal phenotypes observed after DAPI staining occurred in guts of CLas-exposed insects that did not exhibit a positive FISH signal for CLas.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLas-exposed psyllid midgut cells undergo apoptosis.</head><p><s>Nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis are hallmark signatures of cells undergoing cell death, either via apoptosis or necrosis.</s><s>Many of the signaling events that occur in apoptosis and necrosis are shared, including a breakdown of the integrity of the genome DNA and organization of the actin cytoskeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>To investigate the integrity of the genome DNA in apoptotic cells, we isolated DNA from CLas-exposed and non-exposed insect guts and measured the DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis.</s><s>DNA extracted from midguts both CLas-exposed and non-exposed psyllid colonies displayed a clear high molecular weight band greater than 12 Kb.</s><s>The non-exposed insects that were reared on healthy trees showed an additional band with a size of approximately 1500 bps, but this band was not present in samples from CLas-exposed insects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Instead, DNA extracted from the guts of CLas-exposed insects contained a high level of mixed-size, smaller DNA fragments, less than 500 bp.</s><s>Similarly, the actin cytoskeleton appeared unorganized and highly disrupted in CLas-exposed midguts as compared to those dissected from insects reared on healthy plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>These results strongly support the hypothesis that cell death is occurring in CLas-exposed midguts; however, they do not distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether CLas-exposed midguts were undergoing necrosis or apoptosis, we stained midgut cells of psyllids that were reared on either healthy or CLas-infected trees using Annexin V. Phosphatidylserine (PS) moieties, which are recognized by Annexin V, are usually present only on the inner side of the cell membrane.</s><s>In cells undergoing apoptosis, but not necrosis, PS is translocated to the outer cell membrane resulting in the ability to stain PS moieties and to detect apoptotic cells using fluorescently labeled Annexin V.</s><s>The specificity of the PS translocation and PS-Annexin V interaction results in staining of the cell membrane in cells undergoing apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In non-exposed adult psyllid guts reared on healthy plants, Annexin V showed two distinct staining patterns, either a diffused, non-specific signal distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) or no signal at all (not shown).</s><s>In CLas-exposed guts, the signal localized to the gut cell membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), indicating these cells were undergoing apoptosis and not necrosis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Evidence shows the relationship between insect vectors and plant pathogens is along a continuum, where at one end you have a competitive, host-pathogen relationship and at the other end, you have a mutualistic relationship.</s><s>Some, but not all, plant pathogens induce apoptosis in the gut of their insect vectors, suggesting that apoptosis is specific response in a given vector-pathogen system, and will not occur in all such interactions.</s><s>At the ultimate level, apoptosis in vector tissues, among other cellular and immune responses, may be selected for in vector-plant pathogen pairs where the plant pathogen is also a pathogen of the insect vector.</s><s>Along this line of reasoning, it is intriguing that CLas (or the CLas-infected plant) induces apoptosis in the midgut of its psyllid vector and CLso does not.</s><s>At the molecular level, although the genomes of CLso and CLas are similar, they are not identical.</s><s>There might be a role for CLas/CLso-microbiota interactions in the guts of the insect vector in inducing apoptosis, and these interactions should be further investigated.</s><s>The host plants of CLas and CLso are different, and the insects are responding not just to the pathogen, but to the infected plant phloem sap.</s><s>Even among different citrus varieties there is a wide variation of HLB symptoms expressed and the impact of in planta symptom expression on vector tissues and behavior is not known.</s><s>These factors may all play a role in why two closely related plant pathogens, CLas and CLso, appear to have different effects on their insect vectors.</s></p><p><s>An understanding of whether the midgut cells are responding to CLas using apoptosis or necrosis is key to our understanding of the relationship between CLas and its insect vector, where the former response would suggest the ACP cells are active participants in their own demise using the same cellular pathways reserved for normal immune system regulation and development and the latter would suggest a direct response to cell membrane damaging agents leading to cell swelling and lysis.</s><s>Quantification of nuclear disruption showed higher levels in CLas-exposed midguts (65%) but some also occurred in the midguts of non-exposed insects reared on healthy citrus trees, suggesting that it is a process that may occur at a low frequency in the adult midgut as part of the  maintenance of normal gut homeostasis.</s><s>These interpretations are consistent with apoptosis, rather than necrosis, and is further supported by the Annexin V staining and DNA integrity assays.</s></p><p><s>Our data show that the level of apoptosis in the midgut is enhanced in CLas-exposed insects.</s><s>The apoptotic responses observed in the midguts were specific to this tissue, suggesting induction of apoptosis is related to acquisition of CLas by the vector.</s><s>It is pertinent to note previous work has shown that ACP that acquire CLas as adults are inefficient vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , which raises the question as to whether the apoptotic response we observed is correlated or causal to the inability of adults to efficiently become competent for transmission if the bacteria are acquired as adults.</s><s>An alternative hypothesis could be that apoptosis in the midgut serves a protective role in regulating the passage of pathogenic microorganisms such as CLas into the insect hemolymph.</s><s>Unlike CLas, CLso does not seem to induce apoptosis in the guts of potato psyllids <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Since CLas transmission by adult ACP (independent of the developmental stage at which the insect acquires the bacteria) is less efficient than the transmission of CLso by the potato psyllid, we hypothesize that the CLas-induced apoptosis in the midgut is an adaptive, targeted ACP immune response for destroying cells containing the bacteria.</s><s>This response serves to limit the acquisition and transmission efficiency of CLas by the ACP.</s><s>This hypothesis is also in line with the published data showing a minimal effect of CLas on the life history traits of the ACP, including longevity and fecundity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>CLas has a profound effect on the expression of proteins involved in propionate metabolism and the production of short-chain fatty acids in the ACP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>In human cells, short-chain fatty acids have been shown to induce autophagy  as an adaptive strategy to slow the progression of mitochondria-mediated cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , and it is possible that psyllids are using a similar strategy to cope with CLas.</s></p><p><s>The observation of apoptosis in CLas-exposed insects where CLas was not detected and at a lower level in the midguts of insects reared on healthy citrus trees suggests that the phenotype could be mediated by another commensal microorganism residing in the midgut tissues and enhanced by the presence of CLas.</s><s>Alternatively, the nuclear abnormalities we observed could be induced by the infected plant and not directly by the ingested or acquired CLas.</s><s>The nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis phenotypes were weaker in CLas-exposed psyllids that did not harbor detectable levels of CLas as measured by FISH or OmpA immunolocalization as compared to insects which showed a CLas-FISH or OmpA antibody signal, but these data were not quantified here.</s><s>It is quite possible that insects showing intermediate phenotypes for pyknosis and karyorrhexis were indeed CLas-positive, although the bacterial titer was below the limit of FISH or OmpA antibody detection.</s></p><p><s>ACP genome and transcriptome sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and annotation reveals that the vector is tooled with the genes to execute the two well-defined apoptosis pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>The extrinsic pathway is initiated by transmembrane receptors belonging to the TNFR superfamily.</s><s>It is activated by "death ligands" such as TNF-α , TRAIL, and FasL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways involve non-receptor mediated events that act intracellarly to induce changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane that results in the loss of mitochondrial permeability and mitochondrial membrane potential.</s><s>The primary regulators of the intrinsic pathway are proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Caspases, which belong to the family of cysteinyl proteases, are the major components of the apoptotic machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The ACP genome encodes the major apoptosis-related gene families including apoptosis inducing factors, Bcl2s, caspases, DNA fragmentation factor alpha (DFFA) and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs).</s></p><p><s>The role of apoptosis in insects that transmit plant and animal pathogens is not well studied, but new research shows apoptosis can play highly diverse roles in the vector-pathogen relationship.</s><s>Huang and colleagues recently demonstrated that Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) induced apoptosis in the salivary glands of its vector, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens Stål.</s><s>Interfering with apoptosis inhibited RRSV transmission, suggesting that the establishment of apoptosis is critical in maintaining the relationship between the virus and its insect vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, the animal-infecting arbovirus West Nile virus has been shown to induce apoptosis in the midgut and salivary glands of its mosquito vector Culex pipiens pipiens <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>O'Neill and colleagues tested the role of apoptosis as an antiviral defense to Sindbis virus (SINV) infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Mosquitoes were infected with a strain of SINV expressing the proapoptotic gene reaper from Drosophila.</s><s>Insects infected with the mutant virus showed delayed midgut infection and virus replication as well as reduced virus titer in the saliva.</s><s>In addition, they observed a strong negative selection against reaper in virus isolated from individual insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, these studies show that apoptosis is a potent antiviral defense response that is actively targeted by vector-borne pathogens for successful acquisition and transmission.</s><s>Its role in vector-pathogen relationships for bacterial pathogens remains an open question.</s><s>However our work here adds to the accumulating body of work that shows viruses and bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> have developed an array of mechanisms to either escape dell death or to manipulate it for their own benefit during their transmission to the next host and reveals the apoptotic midgut as a potential interdiction point in the acquisition of CLas by the ACP.</s><s>Practically speaking, how may an understanding of apoptosis and the psyllid immune response to CLas be leveraged to control the spread of HLB?</s><s>One approach would be to develop interdiction molecules that interfere with apoptosis in the midgut directly and a second approach involves gene silencing of apoptosis related genes in the psyllid.</s><s>Gut binding peptides that impede the uptake of plant viruses by aphid vectors have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and the discovery of such peptides that interfere with CLas acquisition has been a major and successful focus of the nuPsyllid project, a multidisciplinary project jointly funded by the US Department of Agriculture and the Florida Citrus Research and Development Foundation (CRDF, <ref type="url"

approach, RNAi, is now widely discussed for plant pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>The psyllid genome encodes the machinery for

type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> .</s><s>Field deployment of RNAi strategies could be accomplished via virus induced gene silencing in plants using viral
