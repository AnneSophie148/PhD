for severe diseases in a large number of cultivated and ornamental plants and are transmitted by leafhoppers, planthoppers, and psyllids <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Weintraub and Beanland,

and insecticide treatments against the vector insects when recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Weintraub and Wilson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jeger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Oliveira et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasmas perform a persistent propagative cycle into their insect vectors where they must invade and cross two main barriers, the midgut epithelium and salivary gland cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Maillet and Gouranton, 1971)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, after their ingestion with infected sap, adhesion of phytoplasmas to the apical surface of vector intestinal cells constitutes an initial and critical step in insect invasion.</s><s>Once this first barrier is crossed, the adhesion of phytoplasmas to salivary gland cells is as well critical for transmission to the plant achieved upon injection of infected saliva.</s><s>A given phytoplasma has one or few insect vectors depending on the level of specificity of the interaction.</s><s>Insights into the ecology and populations genetic of the flavescence doreé phytoplasmas (FDp) have revealed the correlation between vector specificity of phytoplasma strains and positively selected variant sequences of phytoplasma variable membrane proteins VmpA and VmpB <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Malembic-Maher et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>It is now known that VmpA is acting as an adhesin that specifically interacts with glycoconjugates at the surface of insect vector cells <ref

phytoplasma colonization of insect cells, and variation in insect glycoproteins might be responsible for insect vector specificity.</s><s>Once attached to insect cells, FD phytoplasmas enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process important for colonization of its insect vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arricau-Bouvery et al., 2023)</ref>.</s><s>Identifying VmpA receptors could provide new insight in the mechanism of entry of the FD phytoplasma into insect cells.</s><s>Moreover, in a context of pesticide reduction, this knowledge could help in developing new strategies of disease control by blocking the phytoplasma-insect cell interaction as it could be achieved for the phloem-sap pest "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" <ref type="bibr">(Merfa et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guo et al., 2023)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Reducing the expression of VmpA receptors in the leafhopper cells in culture should be correlated with a decrease in their ability to bind VmpA.</s><s>Knockdown gene expression is a powerful tool to elucidate gene function and can be achieved by long doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) introduced into the organism or the cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baum et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mondal et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>In RNA interference (RNAi), the long dsRNAs are processed in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that

first identified by mass spectrometry proteins present at the surface of Euscelidius variegatus cell line Euva-11 that potentially interact with the adhesin VmpA by purification on affinity column and far-western blot assays.</s><s>Once these receptor candidates were identified, we intended to screen the candidates by measuring the effect of a decrease of their expression by E. variegatus cells in culture on their ability to bind VmpA-coated latex beads.</s><s>We optimized RNAi to knockdown simultaneously up to 13 genes coding these candidates in the E. variegatus cell line

inflammatory response against the siRNAs and/or the transfectant used to deliver dsRNAs in mammals.</s><s>The second off-target effect is linked to the siRNAinduced sequence-dependent regulation of unintentional transcripts through partial sequence complementary to their 3′UTRs.</s><s>Checking the effect on the other target genes showed that no off-target effect was observed in our case.</s><s>However, even though no partial sequence homology was found in the E. variegatus transcriptome for the genes we tested, we cannot exclude that the expression of other genes could have been affected.</s><s>A study showed that pooling 10 synthetic siRNAs targeting the same mRNA reduced the number and magnitude of offtarget silencing compared to the use of a single siRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kittler et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In our case, we used long dsRNA instead of siRNA.</s><s>The dsRNAs are taken by the RNAi machinery to produce several siRNAs targeting the same mRNA and could induce a reduction of off-target effects.</s><s>The third off-target effect is due to a saturation of the endogenous RNAi machinery by exogenous siRNAs.</s><s>In our case, when we compared the efficiency of the RNAi using one dsRNA (1 μg of dsRNAs) or up to 13 different dsRNA (13 μg of dsRNAs), we did not find any differences for 10 over 12 genes targeted suggesting that the quantity of dsRNAs used did not saturate the RNAi machinery.</s><s>Usually, one gene at a time is knockdown by RNAi using either long dsRNA or multiple siRNAs targeting one gene and introduced by transfection into insect cells or vertebrate cells, respectively.</s><s>We did not find examples of cultured cells transfected with multiple long dsRNA targeting several genes.</s><s>However, an example of three genes silenced using Y-shaped siRNAs was described in a bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kozuch et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>RNAi targeting several genes has been described in insects that were injected with or ingested dsRNA.</s><s>For example, when two genes were targeted with two dsRNAs injected into the planthopper N. lugens or with two dsRNAs or a concatemer ingested by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, knockdown of genes were similar to that observed with injection or ingestion of individual dsRNA.</s><s>Use of concatemer showed an increase of gene

implication of E. variegatus uk1_LRR protein in the adhesion to the vector cell mediated by phytoplasma strain FD92 VmpA.</s><s>Indeed, the inhibition of the adhesion of VmpAcoated beads to Euva cells in culture was only partially achieved.</s><s>The amount of uk1_LRR transcripts, as all of the gene candidates tested, was successfully decreased through RNAi but not completely knockout.</s></p><p><s>We have only few indications about the uk1_LRR function.</s><s>Proteins with such LRR structures are frequently implicated in protein-protein interactions and have a variety of functions including immune response, apoptosis, autophagy, and neuronal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kobe and Kajava, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Matsushima et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>The uk1_LRR protein of E. variegatus contains LRR domains classified in the ribonuclease inhibitor (RI)-like group.</s><s>However, uk1_LRR does not show sequence homology with RI

protein has a different function from RI.</s><s>The other proteins sharing homologies with the uk1_LRR protein also contain the LRR domain classified in the RI-like group.</s><s>However, the diversity of the proteins found, i.e., artichoke-like protein, Toll pathway protein, or Toll-like receptor Tollo, as examples, only share their extracellular position and LRR domains.</s><s>Several proteins

uk1_LRR remains to be identified.</s></p><p><s>We found that uk1_LRR was expressed in both phytoplasmainfected and uninfected insect vectors and was more or less stable over time during insect colonization by the phytoplasma.</s><s>In the early stages of vector infection, right after ingestion of phytoplasma, the expression of uk1_LRR had a tendency to increase in infected insects when compared to same-age adults fed on healthy plants.</s><s>Interestingly, a similar increase in expression was found in infected insect abdomens at 28 days of latency, when insects acquire again phytoplasmas from the faba beans that became systemically infected.</s><s>Indeed, at this timepoint, the phytoplasma titer measured in insect abdomens increased, suggesting that the expression level of uk1_LRR follows the de novo ingestion of phytoplasmas.</s><s>Furthermore, the evaluation of uk1_LRR expression in different insect tissues revealed that the digestive tubes were characterized by the highest level of transcripts when compared to salivary glands and ovaries and eggs.</s><s>Taking consideration of these altogether, uk1_LRR could be implicated in the binding with VmpA in the early stages of insect infection following phytoplasma ingestion, i.e., at the surface of intestine epithelial cells.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
