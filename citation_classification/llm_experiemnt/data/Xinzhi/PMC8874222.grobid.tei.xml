<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rice Plants Co-infected With RSMV and RGDV Showed the Synergistic Symptoms</head><p><s>From January 2018 through October 2021, rice viral diseases in the field of Luoding city were assessed, and results showed that most of rice viral diseases were caused by the co-infection with RSMV and RGDV.</s><s>The rice plants singly infected with RSMV exhibited obvious yellow stripes and mosaic symptoms, the rice plants singly infected with RGDV exhibited dwarfing with abundant galls along the leaf sheaths, while the rice plants co-infected with RSMV and RGDV exhibited severe dwarfing, mosaic and galls along the leaf sheaths (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>We randomly collected rice plants with mosaic stripe or gall dwarf symptom and calculated that about 5%-20% or 9%-27% of rice plants were single RSMV-or RGDV-positive, respectively; however, 55%-84% of rice plants were co-infected (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, more than 69% of virus-infected overwintered rice plants were co-infected (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which became the source of viruses to subsequently infect overwintered R. dorsalis to continue the disease cycle in spring.</s><s>Electron micrographs showed that the bacilliform virions of RSMV and spherical virions of RGDV were orderly distributed in the cytoplasm of singly infected parenchyma of rice phloem (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>In co-infected regions, both virions were observed to associate together (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that RSMV and RGDV may have synergistic relationship during viral co-infection of rice plants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viral Loads of RGDV and RSMV Were Increased in Co-infected Rice Plants</head><p><s>To understand whether RSMV and RGDV have synergistic interaction in rice plants, viral loads of RSMV and RGDV in single or co-infected rice plants were measured by RT-qPCR assay.</s><s>At 30 dpi, RSMV loads in co-infected rice plants were 2.5 times higher than that in RSMV singly infected rice plants, while RGDV loads in co-infected rice plants were 1.4 times higher than that in RGDV singly infected rice plants (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>The accumulation levels of RSMV N and RGDV P8 were quantified by western blot assay.</s><s>As a result, the RSMV N accumulated to higher level in co-infected leaves than in RSMV singly infected rice plants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>However, the accumulation levels of RGDV P8 in co-infected leaves similarly with that in RGDV singly infected leaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that the co-infection significantly increased the viral production of RSMV more than that of RGDV in rice plants.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Plant viruses co-infecting the same hosts may display a great variety of pathways resulting in synergistic or antagonistic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(García-Cano et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Syller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al.</ref>,  2014).</s><s>In this study, two viruses from unrelated families, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae, form the synergistic relationship during co-infection of rice plants and their same vector R. dorsalis.</s><s>The disease caused by RGDV has been epidemic in the field of southern China in the past 40 years; however, the disease caused by RSMV was initially observed in the field of southern China 6 years ago.</s><s>From 2015 to now, RSMV disease distribution is gradually expanding from Guangdong province to the five neighboring provinces <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wang et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Our survey shows that RSMV and RGDV co-infection is common in the field, even up to 84%, which would be a key factor to facilitate the incidence and spread of RSMV epidemics in the field.</s><s>We further show that the synergism between RGDV and RSMV enhances the acquisition and propagation of RSMV in R. dorsalis and thus facilitates the transmission of RSMV.</s><s>In addition, non-viruliferous R. dorsalis prefers to feed on co-infected rice plants, and this process further affects the feeding behavior of R. dorsalis to enhance viral release into rice phloem.</s><s>These results provide the clues as to why RSMV had been gradually expanding and rapid epidemic of RSMV disease in the field.</s><s>We observe that RSMV and RGDV could simultaneously enter the same epithelial cells of intestines during the acquisition of viruses from co-infected rice plants by R. dorsalis.</s><s>Electron microscopy confirms that the direct association of these two types of viral particles in the parenchyma of rice phloem.</s><s>Then, these two viruses assemble progeny virions in the same epithelial cells, which then together spread to the visceral muscle tissues.</s><s>Our results thus reveal that RSMV and RGDV have formed the cooperative interactions during co-infection of rice hosts and insect vectors.</s><s>How RGDV benefits RSMV propagation is still unknown.</s><s>Previously, we have shown that the persistent infection of RGDV in R. dorsalis can trigger a strong small interfering RNA (siRNA) antiviral immune response to efficiently control RGDV replication below a putative cytopathogenic threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lan et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The non-structural protein Pns11 of RGDV is viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSRs) in plant hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Liu et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The highly efficient propagation of RGDV in R. dorsalis likely requires a balance against VSR potency and the antiviral response of the insect vector.</s><s>From this point, we deduce that RGDV might encode a strong VSR for minimizing the siRNA antiviral pathway to facilitate the highly efficient propagation of RSMV in co-infected R. dorsalis.</s><s>Furthermore, another two types of antiviral immune responses, autophagy and apoptosis, have also been triggered by RGDV to facilitate viral efficient spread in R. dorsalis <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., , 2019))</ref>.</s><s>Thus, RGDV can remodel autophagy and apoptosis responses to benefit viral propagation, which may also explain why RSMV becomes highly efficient competence with co-infected R. dorsalis.</s><s>In summary, we demonstrate that a rice reovirus is able to improve the transmission of another rice cytorhabdovirus by the same vector.</s><s>What we have known is that RTBV (a double-stranded circular DNA virus) is dependent on RTSV (a single-stranded RNA virus) for joint transmission by leafhopper vector N. virescenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sta Cruz et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Srilatha et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, co-infection with a wheat rhabdovirus inhibits the acquisition and propagation of Mal de Río Cuarto virus, a plant reovirus, in their planthopper vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dumón et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, RBSDV limits RSV acquisition and transmission by their planthopper vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Moya Fernández et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a better understanding of how different plant viruses reciprocally affect the acquisition, propagation, and accumulation by the same insect vectors will help dissect the underlying causes of the epidemics of these viruses.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Typical signs of Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV) and rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) co-infection in rice.</s><s>(A) Symptoms of virus-infected rice in the field (Luoding, Guangdong, China).</s><s>(B) The dwarf and mosaic signs displayed on rice plants singly infected with RSMV, RGDV or co-infected with RSMV and RGDV.</s><s>(C) Electron micrographs of virions in RSMV-infected, RGDV-infected, or co-infected rice leaves.</s><s>Healthy rice leaf was as control.</s><s>Panels I-IV are the enlarged images of the red boxed areas I-IV in the above panels.</s><s>Red arrows indicate a RGDV virion adhered to a RSMV virion in the cytoplasm of co-infected rice leaf.</s><s>CW, cell wall;
