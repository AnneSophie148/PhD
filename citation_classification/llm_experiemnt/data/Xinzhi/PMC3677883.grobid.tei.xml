<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observation and Photomicrography of ACP Nymphs, Adults and their Anal Excretion Behavior</head><p><s>ACP nymphs and adults used here were taken from our healthy laboratory colony (not infected with Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus) that has been maintained for several generations on young healthy citrus plants (Citrus macrophylla Wester) in the greenhouse.</s><s>Anal (honeydew) excretion behavior of ACP was observed and photographed using a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ16) fitted with a Leica DFC 320 camera, or using another stereomicroscope (Leica M60) fitted with a video camera (Leica DFC290 HD) (Leica, Switzerland).</s><s>For these observations, ACP nymphs of various instars were fed in groups (10-20/group) on small pieces of fresh terminal young shoots (8-10 cm long) of sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, var.</s><s>Ridge Pineapple].</s><s>ACP adult males and females, separately, were also fed in groups (5-10/group) on excised young Ridge Pineapple sweet orange leaves.</s><s>The cut end of each terminal shoot or leaf petiole was placed in a small (0.5 ml) microfuge tube filled with water to keep it fresh for 3-7 days.</s><s>Each shoot or leaf was then placed in a 50-ml polypropylene tube (BD Falcon Conical Tubes with Flip-Top Cap; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or in a Petri dish for easier observation under the stereomicroscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>The rearing tubes or Petri-dishes were placed on the bench top in the laboratory (at 23.761.5uC)</s><s>with 14 hr light per day.</s><s>Identification of various nymphal instars of ACP followed the drawings by Catling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Honeydew excretion was observed via stereomicroscopy in hundreds of ACP nymphs of various instars and in more than 50 male and 50 female adults.</s><s>Throughout this paper, ACP males and females refer to the adult stage of ACP.</s></p><p><s>Video recordings (1-2 h each) of anal (honeydew) excretion behavior of ACP males, females and nymphs as well as oviposition by females were undertaken.</s><s>Video S1, provided here (1 min 52 sec.</s><s>long), is composed of 4 short clips showing one male producing two consecutive excretion droplets, one on top of the other (2 separate clips), followed by one female producing one pellet (one clip), and finally another female (at lower right) producing another pellet (one clip).</s><s>All clips were recorded at real time (normal speed).</s><s>Since the females are much faster than males, with regard to their honeydew excretion actions, the male clips are played back at normal speed whereas the female clips are played back at a much slower speed (1/16 th their actual speed).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of ACP anal Structures, Honeydew and Waxy Secretions</head><p><s>Three methods were used to prepare ACP nymphs, exuviae and/or adults for SEM to study the ultrastructure of their anal areas.</s><s>The first method involved fixation and dehydration of live insects in 70% ethanol, 100% ethanol (twice) then air drying before mounting.</s><s>The second method, used mainly with exuviae, was direct mounting without prior fixation or dehydration.</s><s>A third method was used to clean the nymphs or adult females from their honeydew and waxy secretions, in order to examine the openings and structure of the circumanal ring (around the anus).</s><s>This 'dewaxing/cleaning' method, modified from Lucchi and Mazzoni <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, involved soaking the insects in 100% chloroform in a small glass dish covered with a glass slide for 4 h to overnight at room temperature in a fume hood, before air drying.</s><s>Honeydew excretions obtained from ACP nymphs, males and females, separately in glass Petri-dishes, were also prepared for SEM using only the second (direct mounting) method.</s><s>These included the whitish, waxy honeydew tubes and pellets produced by nymphs and females respectively (Figs. <ref type="figure">1B-D</ref>), as well as the clear honeydew droplets deposited on citrus leaves by males (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">F</ref>), taken with part of the leaf it was laid on.</s><s>Preliminary work indicated that ACP honeydew excretions usually absorb moisture, swell, and lose their compact form if they were stored at 4uC or at room temperature under humid conditions.</s><s>Thus, ACP honeydew was normally stored under vacuum for a few to several days in a desiccator, half filled with silica gel (baked at 120uC for 3 h) at room temperature, before they were processed for SEM or infrared microscopy (see below).</s></p><p><s>In all three SEM preparation methods mentioned above, the insects, exuviae or honeydew were mounted, under a stereomicroscope, on black conductive double-sided adhesive discs (9-12 mm diameter) placed on aluminum stubs (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA), using fine-pointed forceps (Fontax no.</s><s>5; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA).</s><s>Mounted specimens were then sputter coated with Gold-Palladium for 120 sec using Hummer 6.2 Sputter Coater (Anatech USA, Union City, CA).</s><s>Coated specimens were then examined at 5 or 10 Kv using a scanning-transmission electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800, Hitachi, Pleasanton, CA) in the SEM mode at magnifications of 100X to 10,000X.</s><s>The number of ACP specimens examined by SEM was 8-12 waxed or dewaxed specimens in each of the following categories: males, females and nymphs.</s><s>All the original electron micrographs digitally obtained in this study were automatically saved on the image management computer program (Quartz PCI version 8) associated with the Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope mentioned above.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infrared Microscopy and Spectroscopic Analysis of ACP Honeydew</head><p><s>Spectra of the honeydew produced by ACP nymphs, males and females were obtained using the Thermo Nicolet iN10 FTIR microscope in the reflection mode (for intact honeydew samples), as well as the attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) mode (for crushed samples).</s><s>Microscope, spectrometer, data acquisition and data processing functions were done using Thermo Nicolet Picta software.</s><s>To acquire the spectra in the FTIR mode, honeydew samples were placed on an aluminum coated slide, which was mounted on the stage of the microscope.</s><s>The microscope was focused on the top surface of these honeydew structures, and a linear spectra map was created along the long axis of the top surface of the tube/ribbon.</s><s>Spectra were acquired at a resolution of 8 cm 21 averaging a total of 128 scans at each position along the map.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honeydew Forms and Anal Excretion Behavior of ACP Nymphs, Males and Females</head><p><s>ACP adult males and females, reared separately on citrus leaves or young terminal shoots, were found to feed for long periods at the same feeding site (up to 1-2 hrs), judging by their typical feeding posture, with their body angled ca.</s><s>40u with the leaf surface (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>The color and texture of anal (honeydew) excretions from males and females were markedly different.</s><s>ACP males produced clear (colorless) droplets of sticky material (ca.</s><s>500-900 mm diameter) usually placed very closely behind their bodies (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">F</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infrared and Spectroscopy Analysis of Honeydew of ACP Nymphs and Adults</head><p><s>Preliminary attempts using attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of ACP honeydew (in which the samples were crushed on the diamond ATR crystal and then scanned) showed no sign of wax being present in the honeydew of nymphs, males or females.</s><s>Typically, ATR-FTIR analysis of these excretions indicated that this material is composed mainly of water and sugars.</s><s>The spectra are characterized by huge broad bands in the region from 3600-2800 cm 21 , attributed to water and hydroxyl groups, and other large bands from 1100 to 1000 cm 21 attributed to the carbon-oxygen single bonds of sugars, including sucrose, fructose and Beta-D-(+)-glucose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Peaks in the region from 2850 to 3050 cm 21 due to C-H bonds were weak and ill-defined, which is characteristic of wet sugar samples.</s></p><p><s>Given these findings, we reasoned that if wax was present in the honeydew of ACP females and nymphs, as our SEM studies above suggested, it must be only on the surface of the honeydew pellets or tubes produced by females and nymphs respectively.</s><s>Thus, the samples were subjected to FTIR reflectance microscopy, in which intact honeydew samples were not crushed but simply scanned after the microscope is carefully focused on the upper surface of the honeydew structures.</s><s>While the large peaks mentioned above (typical of sugars) also existed in the FTIR reflectance microscopy spectra of the top/surface of the honeydew of males, females and nymphs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), spectra of the female and nymphal honeydew also displayed peaks in the 1735-1745 cm 21 range attributed to the carboxyl C = O of the wax esters as well as two pronounced peaks at 2850 and 2920 cm 21 attributed to C-H bonds of aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty and ester waxes such as bees wax (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>No pronounced peaks typical of bees or ester waxes were found in FTIR spectra of the surface of ACP male honeydew (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Feeding on the phloem presents certain challenges to hemipteran insects, which normally have certain adaptations to counter these challenges.</s><s>First, the high sugar content and osmotic pressure of phloem sap is countered by sucrose-transglucosidase activity in their guts, which transforms excess sugar into long-chain oligosaccharides voided as honeydew excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This, however, presents another problem for these insects: how to avoid being contaminated or even drowned by their own sticky, sugar-rich, honeydew <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, especially for the more vulnerable eggs and young nymphs.</s></p><p><s>ACP produces copious amounts of honeydew excretions by nymphs and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Although it has been suggested earlier that these excretions are covered with 'waxy material' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> the chemical or ultrastructural composition of this material, as well as the fine structure of the wax gland openings in ACP or other psyllids have not been reported earlier.</s><s>Previous investigations on ACP adult honeydew indicated that its major components were: sucrose, D-fructose, mannose, trehalose, myo-inositol, ribitol, galactose, quinic acid, and malic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In our present work, we show that, in addition to various sugars, the honeydew of ACP nymphs and adult females are covered by a thin layer similar in its IR spectrum to those of bees wax and other ester waxes.</s><s>The chemical composition of waxes produced by Hemiptera have been investigated mainly in whiteflies and scale insects.</s><s>The surface lipids on nymphs and exuvia of several whitefly species (Aleyrodidae) contained largely wax esters, long-chain aldehydes, hydrocarbons and long-chain alcohols <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The wax (circumanal) glands in nymphs and female adults of the apple psyllid (P.</s><s>mali) were described at the light microscopy level by <ref type="bibr">Brittain [27]</ref> as 'lobular masses directly beneath the cuticle, consisting of tall columnar epithelial cells with a well defined nucleus at the base and frequently a space filled with secretion between the cells'.</s><s>Waku <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, studied wax glands in nymphs of another psyllid (A.</s><s>mori) by transmission electron microscopy, and indicated that these glands consisted of two kinds of cells, derived from epidermal cells: wax cells, which produce and secrete the wax, and flat interstitial cells found among these cells.</s><s>Each wax cell has a long, wide duct which opens at the cuticle.</s><s>The openings of the wax glands in the circumanal ring of psyllid nymphs and females were also described at the light microscopy level by Brittain <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Husain and Nath <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> in P. mali and D. citri, respectively.</s><s>It is surprising how accurate these descriptions were, given the resolution of the light microscopy when compared with SEM.</s><s>However, our SEM work here provided much finer details of the wax pores and cuticular slits found on the circumanal ring of ACP females and/or nymphs.</s><s>The wax pores we described here, especially in ACP nymphs, are somewhat ultrastructurally similar to openings of the wax glands, described as 'canaliculated cuticle', in the nymphal anal ring of the psyllid A. mori <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>But they are considerably different from the .</s><s>FTIR microscope reflection spectra of the surface of male, female and nymphal honeydew excretions (top three panels) compared to attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectra of typical monosaccharides.</s><s>The honeydew spectra contain many peaks attributable to simple saccharides, especially the broad peak centered at 3300 cm 21 attributable to the O-H bonds in sugars and water, and broad poorly resolved peaks at frequencies lower than 1500 cm 21 which indicate a mixture of the saccharides whose spectra appear in the lower three panes.</s><s>However, the peaks at 2850 and 2910 cm 21 are more pronounced in the honeydew and the peak at 1733 cm 21 does not appear in the saccharide spectra.</s><s>The male excreta show spectra typical of aqueous sugars.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064938.g004</s></p><p><s>'wax pores' found on wings of the flatid planthopper Metcalfa pruinosa (Fulgoroidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, or from 'pores in the wax gland plates' on the cuticle of some aphid species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The primary role of the wax layer on the honeydew of ACP nymphs and females is likely to limit/minimize the contamination of nymphs and eggs by the thick, sticky and sugary honeydew.</s><s>Similarly, Smith <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> suggested that the primary role of the secreted wax on the surface of aphid cuticle is to prevent the aphids becoming contaminated by their own honeydew as well as that of other members of a colony.</s><s>This may also be the purpose of the difference in behavior, reported here, between ACP males and females in their honeydew excretion behavior.</s><s>Males deposit their honeydew droplets, devoid of waxy material, immediately behind them, whereas the females cannot do the same (otherwise they will likely smother their deposited eggs and newly hatched nymphs with this sticky material).</s><s>Hence, females not only produce waxcovered excretions but also propel them some distance to the side away from their bodies, their eggs, and newly hatched nymphs.</s><s>Heavy feeding and honeydew production by nymphs or adults of another psyllid (Ctenarytaina thysanura) greatly reduced the attractiveness of terminal shoots for oviposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>This deterrence was associated with the production of honeydew resulting in the development of sooty moulds.</s><s>That ACP nymphs and females have certain mechanisms and adaptations to avoid contamination with honeydew whereas ACP males apparently do not is interesting, and suggests that ACP males and females may occupy different sites on citrus plants, especially with regard to egg laying.</s><s>ACP females normally lay their eggs on very young, feathery and folded leaves, or in the axillary corners between young terminal shoots and leaf petioles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1H</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, whereas males were not normally observed feeding on these sites (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>In addition to the wax covering of their honeydew excretions, ACP nymphs seem to have developed two more ways to minimize contamination with honeydew.</s><s>First, the wax-covered circumabdominal setae (around the abdomen), found in nymphs but not in adults of either sex, appear to keep the long honeydew ribbons or tubes away from their bodies (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">1C</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>These setae were described earlier by light microscopy in ACP nymphs as 'lanceolate setae' by Husain and Nath <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, who also indicated that they were covered with narrow tubular sheaths of waxy secretion, produced by glands situated around their bases.</s><s>Second, we observed that most of the nymphs feeding on the upper side of the leaf usually leave their long honeydew tubes or ribbons behind attached to the exuvia during molting (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).</s><s>In the field, honeydew tubes or ribbons are infrequently noticeable (unpublished observations), perhaps due to wind or wind-induced movement of citrus leaves.</s><s>In addition to reducing contamination with honeydew, it has been suggested that waxy secretions in aphids may also provide 'a microclimate coat' or afford some protection against fungus, parasite or predator attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>But this may be true mainly with insects that produce wax filaments on larger areas of their cuticle, not just their circumanal ring or circumabdominal setae, like mealybugs, scale insects, some aphids and planthoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The phloem feeding scale insects and mealybugs are known to posses several mechanisms to limit contamination from their own sticky honeydew excretions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>: 1. filaments of wax often coat the insect body so that honeydew droplets do not adhere to it; 2. the anal opening is surrounded by an anal ring that usually bears setae and pores, wax from these pores coats the anal ring setae and prevents honeydew droplets from sticking to them; and 3. the anal ring has certain ways by which it can propel the honeydew away from the inset body.</s><s>Our study shows that ACP nymphs may have mechanisms similar to the first two mentioned above, but the wax produced is on the surface of honeydew excretions and circumabdominal setae rather than on the insect body itself.</s><s>We also show that ACP females posses something similar to the third mechanism, i.e. propelling their wax-covered excretions to the side away from their bodies.</s><s>To our knowledge, this behavioral difference between males and females has not been described earlier for ACP or other psyllid species.</s><s>We hope that this investigation furthers our understanding of the biology, adaptations and survival of this group of hemipteran insects that is economically important on many field and horticultural crops worldwide.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
