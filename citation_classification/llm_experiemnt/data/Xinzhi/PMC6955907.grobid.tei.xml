<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Huanglongbing (HLB, also known as citrus greening), the most destructive disease to citrus plants in the world, is putatively caused in Asia and the Americas by the phloem-restricted gram-negative bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri, Hemiptera: Liviidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Current management options for HLB are limited and heavily rely on the application of chemical insecticides for limiting ACP vector populations.</s><s>However, these strategies are challenging because of application and environmental problems and the development of insecticide resistance among psyllid populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>A better understanding of the transmission process of CLas by its psyllid vector and the molecular mechanisms that underlay this process, could result in alternate management practices against the HLB disease.</s></p><p><s>CLas is an obligate pathogen that lives inside both the plant and the insect hosts.</s><s>In the plant, CLas localizes in the phloem tissue, and is taken up by D. citri when the insect feeds.</s><s>After feeding, it is hypothesized that CLas moves throughout the insect body in a circulative-propagative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Transmission of CLas depends on the ability of the bacteria to multiply within the insect tissue and on its ability to cross barriers during the transmission pathway especially the gut-hemolymph and the hemolymph-salivary glands barriers.</s><s>D. citri adults that acquired CLas as nymphs can remain infective throughout their life, and it was shown that they can transmit CLas much better than those that acquire the bacteria as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>This difference might result from the longer phloem feeding periods of nymphs compared to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It was shown that CLas also propagates more efficiently in the nymphal stages of ACP compared to the adults, and this can also contribute to the higher transmission efficiency of ACP that acquire CLas as nymphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Differences in the innate immunity between D. citri nymphs and adults have been suggested, based on quantitative proteomic and microscopic studies of healthy and CLas-infected ACP <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Understanding the interactions between D. citri and CLas at the cellular and subcellular levels is important to our understanding of pathogen-vector interactions.</s><s>Ultrastructural localization of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CLso), another member of the genus Ca.</s><s>Liberibacter that cause diseases in solanaceous and umbelliferous crops, was studied in the potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli.</s><s>Results showing that the CLso bacteria were present in various organs including the gut and the salivary gland, pointed to a systemic invasion of potato psyllids by CLso and supported a propagative, circulative mode of transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The anatomy of D. citri has been studied earlier by Ammar et al. and Cicero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The ultrastructure of the salivary glands, filter chamber, alimentary canal, compound ganglionic mass (in the thorax), and the bacteriome (in the abdomen) has been described, but without the presence of CLas cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Some early investigations reported that bacteria-like structures assumed huanglongbing pathogens in D. citri, without any supporting immuno-or molecular-labeling evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Using qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the presence of CLas genome was detected in various psyllid organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, suggesting a systemic infection.</s><s>Recently, Ghanim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> showed that in CLas infected D. citri guts, CLas accumulates inside Liberibacter containing vacuoles (LCVs), and that these vacuoles associate with the host cell rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), suggesting that CLas can accumulate intracellularly in the psyllid cells.</s><s>However, whether this occurs in cells other than those in the midgut is still unknown.</s></p><p><s>Here, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold labeling to study the ultrastructural morphology and localization of CLas, inside different organs and tissues of infected ACP.</s><s>Our results showed that CLas is abundantly found in tubular/filamentous and quasispherical forms in many different ACP organs and tissues, indicating a systemic infection.</s><s>Putative CLas multiplications sites (associated with RER) in the cytoplasm of infected cells are also described.</s><s>Our results point to the close cellular and subcellular association between CLas and its psyllid vector, and provide a strong support for a circulative-propagative mode of CLas transmission by ACP.</s></p></div>
