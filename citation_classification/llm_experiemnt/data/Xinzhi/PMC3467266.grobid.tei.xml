be justified for prevention or management <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Potentially vulnerable assets can be identified using bioclimatic modelling tools, however, economic theory holds that for two pests that have similar vulnerable assets, the faster-spreading one is more costly, because its impacts will accrue more rapidly <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Evaluating the potential spread of a pest in the PRA area is challenging because both spatial and temporal processes are involved.</s><s>Besides, the area of potential establishment, the presence of natural dispersal barriers, the dispersal capability of individuals, the potential vectors of the pest, the potential movements with commodities and transport, but also predators, mutualisms and many other biotic and abiotic factors can be involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Formal PRA schemes (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) typically require qualitative assessments of potential spread, through answers to questions such as: ''How does the pest spread?'', ''How far can the pest spread within a given time?'', ''How fast can the pest invade the area of potential establishment?'' and levels of uncertainty are often requested.</s><s>Such qualitative assessments of the potential spread rely on expert judgment.</s><s>Extrapolation can be made from other situations: the spread of the pest in another region or the spread of a closely related species (see PRAs made by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization, EPPO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</s><s>In some cases, the qualitative assessment of potential spread is insufficient, and quantitative estimation is desirable, especially when the cost-effectiveness of phytosanitary measures is at stake <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Theoretical

target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>).</s><s>These models address details of the life cycle and dispersal mechanisms, and they take considerable time and effort to develop, parameterise and test.</s><s>It is not realistic to request the development of species-specific complex models in real world PRAs because risk assessors are generally not modellers, and they lack the time, resources and training to do it.</s><s>Instead, there is a need for generic modelling tools in PRAs that can be used by risk assessors to capture the main processes driving the invasion process of alien species.</s><s>While developments towards generalization and more unified application of complex modelling platforms in spread modelling for PRA are underway (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>), there is as yet no modelling toolbox that risk assessors may use to conduct rapid appraisals of pest spread in the context of a PRA.</s></p><p><s>The European Union 7 th Framework project PRATIQUE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> aimed to deliver new tools to assist the risk assessor in the PRA.</s><s>In this project, we developed a prototype for a generic spread modelling toolbox that risk assessors may use in PRAs in the future.</s><s>The prototype consists of a suite of parsimonious ecological models for population growth and dispersal processes, with linkages to fundamental niche maps, based on climate suitability and presence of hosts or non-climatic habitat factors.</s><s>While most of the model components are well established in the ecological literature, they have never before been brought together in an overarching integrated framework meant for future use (after appropriate testing and familiarization) in PRA.</s><s>We conducted several case studies in collaboration with practical pest risk analysts with specific species knowledge to test the tools and develop a proof of concept.</s><s>We present one case study in detail for illustration, including a sensitivity analysis.</s><s>Finally, we report

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of the Area of Potential Establishment</head><p><s>To apply the spread models for an invasive species, it is firstly necessary to define the area of potential establishment (the fundamental niche) of the alien species.</s><s>This area is defined by favourable climatic conditions for long-term survival, the availability of host plants for plant pests and pathogens, suitable habitats and other abiotic factors, e.g.</s><s>soil pH for plants and soildwelling organisms such as nematodes.</s><s>Assessing the establishment potential of a pest in a PRA area is part of all PRA procedures and there is a large variety of methods and information sources to inform such assessments (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Here we used the outputs of a CLIMEX model run on gridded climatic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> to define the area of potential establishment.</s><s>We used two CLIMEX outputs in the spread modelling.</s><s>These are the Ecoclimatic Index (EI, from 0 to 100) and the annual Growth Index (GI A , from 0 to 100; from here on written as GI), where the EI characterizes the suitability of the climate for long term survival and the GI indicates the potential for population growth during favourable seasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>The CLIMEX model was run on a 0.560.5 degree grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>As the dimensions of grid cells are defined in degrees, the size of grid cells varies with Latitude (Materials S1).</s><s>To ensure consistency between map layers, the spread model implementation uses the grid on which the climatic and host inputs are defined.</s><s>In the applications in this paper, the simulation grid for spread modelling is therefore a 0.560.5 degree grid.</s><s>We define a ''suitable cell'' as a cell located within the area of potential establishment, based on climate and host or habitat, and an ''invaded cell'' as a cell that is not only suitable but also occupied by the study species.</s><s>Unsuitable cells cannot be occupied.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the Spread Models</head><p><s>The four models developed here can be uniquely classified by considering two criteria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>):</s></p><p><s>-whether the output variable is the occupancy of the pest (presence/absence -models A and B) or the pest density (percentage of the carrying capacity -models C and D) in each grid cell, -whether the model ignores the geographical distance between the cells (spatially implicit -models A and C) or describes both temporal and spatial processes taking into account dispersal distance (spatially explicit -models B and D).</s></p><p><s>Models A and C are not true spread models in a strict sense because they primarily focus on population growth over time which influences, but does not directly predict, the potential for population spread in space.</s><s>However, these simple demographic models describe an important component of the invasion process and provide part of the theoretical basis for some true invasion models.</s><s>They partly explain the spread rate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, these models have potential usefulness for PRA.</s><s>We therefore consider all of these four models and call them ''spread models'' for brevity.</s><s>Hereafter these models are described in more detail.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model A: Output Variable is Occupancy and Model Ignores the Geographical Distance</head><p><s>The first model describes the logistic increase of the invaded area over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>The invaded area is determined by the number of cells and these cells are then allocated to positions within the area of potential establishment depending on their asset value, according to three scenarios: best, worst, and random.</s><s>This occupancy model considers the increase of the number of invaded cells over time, starting from one or more invaded cells at the beginning of the simulation.</s><s>The final state of the model is that all cells that are in the area of potential establishment are occupied.</s><s>The logistic growth model is implemented as a difference equation at a one year time step: where n t is the number of invaded cells as a percentage of the number of cells within the area of potential establishment at time t, and r is the relative rate of increase of the invaded area (yr 21 ).</s><s>The user needs to identify one initial value, the percentage of cells initially invaded (n 0 , %) and estimate a single parameter, r, which is the only parameter in the model.</s><s>In addition, the user needs to provide data on the economic values of assets (affected hosts) across the area of potential establishment because the model takes into account values at risk in each cell and assigns the new invasions preferentially to the most valuable cells in the worst case scenario, or to the least valuable cells in the best case scenario.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n t ~n0 exp (r t) 1zn 0 ( exp (r t){1)=100<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p><s>There is also a random dispersal scenario in which invaded cells are assigned irrespective of their asset value.</s><s>The economic impact is calculated directly in each of these scenarios by adding the asset value over all invaded cells at a given time t.</s><s>The resulting number estimates the total asset value at risk in invaded cells.</s><s>A damage function that calculates the actual yield loss in the invaded cells is not included here, but would be straightforward to add.</s><s>The results can be summarized in a bar chart representing the frequency of invaded cells according to their economic value.</s></p><p><s>Results can also be presented on a map, but the user should be aware that the location of invaded cells at time t is generated by a spatially implicit model that does not explicitly consider spatial processes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model B: Output Variable is Occupancy and Model Considers the Geographical Distance</head><p><s>The second model is also an occupancy model.</s><s>It simulates radial range expansion at a constant rate c (km/yr).</s><s>Since the outcome is similar to reaction diffusion models (which generate an invasion wave with a constant asymptotic speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>), model B can be regarded as a simplified version of reaction diffusion models and the expansion rate c as an integrated estimate of both mean distance of dispersal and population growth.</s><s>The user should provide the initial point(s) of entry, and the model will generate circles around this for different times t.</s><s>The distance between circles describing the invaded range in subsequent years is defined by the radial rate of range expansion c.</s><s>These circles represent the border of the maximum range and all suitable cells located in this range are considered invaded.</s><s>In sum, this model has one parameter, c, and needs one or more entry points of the pest as initialization.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The generic spread models presented here, give a set of different scenarios that can help risk assessors to determine the potential temporal or spatial expansion of pests in a pest risk assessment.</s><s>The spatially implicit model for logistic growth of the amount of occupied area (Model A) provides a direct assessment of the assets at risk, but it requires spatially explicit data on their economic value.</s><s>The difficulty of obtaining such economic data was the main reason why risk assessors found this model difficult to use in their case study, despite the simplicity of the underlying logistic spread model.</s><s>The range expansion model B provides an easy way to map the potential geographic spread of the pest through time, but it suffers from lack of biological realism, especially if the pest enters an area that is marginally suitable for survival and growth and where the rate of range expansion would be lower than that predicted by this model.</s><s>The spatially implicit model for logistic density increase (Model C) can be used to identify areas where the pest can grow rapidly to damaging levels.</s><s>The spatially explicit model for population growth and dispersal (Model D) simulates both spatial and temporal dynamics more realistically using only three biological parameters: l max , u and n.</s><s>Out of all these simple models, model D can be considered to be the most sophisticated.</s><s>The increase of model complexity provides more flexibility and the ability to describe a wider range of processes.</s><s>Thus, complex models can potentially give better descriptions of pest spread.</s><s>For instance, model D can simulate both short and long distance dispersal.</s><s>These two dispersal mechanisms cannot be simulated by the other models.</s><s>However, increasing model complexity means that more parameters are needed, more data are required for their estimation and the overall uncertainty in the parameter values can play an important role.</s><s>To assist the PRA process, spread models should be applicable to a wide variety of species for which more or less amount of information are available.</s><s>Consequently, these models should stay as simple as possible.</s><s>In this study, these models complement each other by using different assumptions and initial conditions to provide predictions of population growth and spatial expansion of pests over time, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of potential spread.</s><s>Together these models allow a more profound and better informed interpretation of spread and invasion risks than a single model could do, leading to a more robust basis for exploring invasion scenarios within a PRA.</s></p><p><s>The key difficulty in using these models in PRA is estimating the parameters.</s><s>There is no universal method for estimation since this depends on the available data.</s><s>As shown for D. virgifera virgifera, values of parameters are not directly published in the literature, and a good understanding of the parameters' meaning in the context of the model is needed to extract the required values from data.</s><s>It would be of great help to risk assessors if a database were developed listing parameter values for example species that might then guide parameterization for species with similar population dynamics and dispersal traits.</s><s>The shortlist of seven case study species in the current paper provides a beginning for such a list.</s></p><p><s>The sensitivity analysis shows that is extremely important to obtain correct estimates of the parameters.</s><s>The relative rate of increase (r; model A) is the most sensitive parameter (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) and needs very careful estimation.</s><s>Although model D has the largest number of parameters, its global sensitivity was not considerably higher (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Parameters associated with long distance dispersal are known to affect the asymptotic invasion wave speed and have a great impact on the potential spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s><s>However, in model D, the shape parameter n, governing the proportion of long distance dispersers, does not have the strongest effect on the invaded area (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Because of the tight interaction between growth and dispersal processes, the parameters associated with dispersal (u and n) mostly affected the overall population density (at least for the range of values tested in this study).</s></p><p><s>A key requirement for using models for prediction is that their validity for this purpose should be demonstrated.</s><s>This validation can be divided into predictive validity and structural validity.</s><s>The key challenge for predictive validity is the availability of data.</s><s>Validation requires that a model is first parameterized with data and then tested with independent data (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>).</s><s>Due to the scarcity of usable data, especially for predictive validation in the context of PRAs, we have not attempted such a validation in this study.</s><s>Validation therefore mainly results from structural validity: all the models rely on or derive from well-established models with a strong theoretical basis (such as logistic growth, diffusion model or dispersal kernel).</s><s>Comparing the model outputs also give an indirect indication of their validity.</s><s>This detailed comparison of the models was not undertaken in this study, except in the user evaluation, which can be considered to be a ''soft'' and nonquantitative comparison.</s><s>In ecological modelling, different models can be proposed for a process, and the best model for the data selected.</s><s>A sophisticated and satisfying way for model selection is the use of likelihood to assess model fit and penalize models for the number of parameters, e.g. using Akaike's Information Criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, the application of such a formal model selection framework is problematic for comparing the four models proposed in this study because the models have different outputs (two simulate occupancy and two simulate density), and they have different initial conditions: one spatially random (model A); one spatially implicit (model C), and two initialized at a point (models B and D).</s><s>These differences make a formal comparison of model outputs meaningless.</s><s>The key issue is whether the model is ''fit for purpose'' and this depends critically, not only on model prediction quality, but as much on the requirements of the end user.</s><s>We therefore conducted an expert elicitation to assess user opinion as to the question of whether models are potentially useful in PRA practice.</s><s>Caution is needed to interpret the low number of assessments (only 8), but, overall, the assessment is a positive one.</s><s>It was frequently stated that PRA analysts would need greater guidance in using the models.</s><s>Further model testing and building a database of case studies could be very useful for providing guidance.</s><s>The usability of these models in the PRA context is shown not only by the experts' testing and feedback but also by the availability of a decision support scheme (DSS) on quantitative spread modelling integrated in a generic PRA DSS (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Application of the spread models should take account of technical issues that relate to the spatial resolution of the grid cells.</s><s>The size of the cells should be small enough to avoid calculation errors but large enough to avoid unreasonably long time durations of simulations (especially for model D).</s><s>The models were implemented in the statistical language R <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and two versions of the code have been written: a decimal degree version (which simulates the spread over a regular grid in decimal degrees) and a metric version (which simulates the spread over a regular 10 km grid in the European system projection LAEA).</s><s>An advantage of the first version is that it is broadly applicable to any part of the world while an advantage of the second version is that it generates maps at the European scale that can be more easily combined with other risk maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The models presented currently use the outputs of a CLIMEX model to define the area of potential establishment and the population growth.</s><s>Adapting the spread models to another bioclimatic model such as those available in NAPPFAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> is straightforward in principle as long as the bioclimatic model can provide similar information, in particular indices with interpretations similar to the growth and eco-climatic indices of CLIMEX, where the growth index characterizes the potential for population growth during the favourable season(s) while the eco-climatic index integrates this potential for population growth with stresses during unfavourable seasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The four spread models presented here represent a selection from the potential range of techniques that could be applied.</s><s>It is possible to explore other modelling techniques.</s><s>For example, the difficulties the experts had in using model A were confounded by the need for spatially explicit data on the value of assets at risk.</s><s>In addressing this issue, it is possible to abandon the need for spatially explicit data for the value of assets at risk, and simply combine the spread function in model A (simplicity in parameterisation) with a total asset value figure as a means of estimating the intermediate scenario costs through time.</s><s>Similarly, it is possible to apply the other spatially implicit model (C) to ordinated assets to assess the best and worst case scenarios.</s><s>Ultimately, the choice of modelling method should depend on the PRA question at hand (spread or impact?), the availability of data, and the preference of the risk assessor for more or less detail in the modelling approach.</s></p><p><s>While several biologically based models have been developed to study the invasion processes of exotic pests, few are simple and general enough to be applicable in the context of PRA.</s><s>We should however be wary of employing techniques that are unnecessarily complex, especially when there are difficulties in selecting reliable values for sensitive parameters (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), and when there have been so few examples of spread models validated with independent data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Carrasco <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> developed a modelling framework for pest invasion that
