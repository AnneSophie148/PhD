<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Phytoplasma is a group of bacteria that are unculturable in vitro due to them lacking a cell wall, localised in the phloem of diverse host plants (more than 1000 species), vectored by phloem-feeding insects and taxonomically classified in the genus "Candidatus Phytoplasma", which accommodates 44 species separated based on 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Rice (Oryza sativa) is known to be affected by two phytoplasmas: rice yellow dwarf phytoplasma (RYDP), causing rice yellow disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, and rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP), causing rice orange leaf disease (ROLD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>The RYDP belongs to "Ca.</s><s>P. oryzae" (16SrXI group), while the ROLP is classified in "Ca.</s><s>P. asteris" (16SrI group) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Ca.</s><s>P. asteris also includes important pathogens of diseases, such as oenothera aster yellows, onion yellows, rhus yellows, mulberry dwarf and paulownia witches' broom <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Today, the detection of ROLP mainly relies on nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sanger sequencing of the amplicon with approximately 1.2 kbp <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The RYDP-infected rice exhibits leaf chlorosis, profuse tillers with stunting and results in the failure of grain production, which are distinct from ROLD symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The rice yellow disease by RYDP has been reported in many rice-growing countries of East and Southeast Asia since its first record in Southwestern region of Japan in 1910 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s>RYDP is known to be vectored by several green leaf hopper (GLH) species such as Nephotettix nigropictus St√•l, N. cincticeps Uhle and N. virescens Distant (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s>These insects also transmit viruses including rice dwarf virus, rice tungro spherical virus and rice tungro bacilliform virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, ROLD is represented by orange leaf colouration starting from the leaf tip downwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The ROLP-affected plants are often moderately stunted, leaves roll inwards and cause senescence, reduced tiller numbers are observed and eventually significant grain yield loss is caused <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>.</s><s>The degree of these symptoms varies according to the infection time, plant condition and environment-for example, leaf discoloration was observed from yellow to golden or deep orange, and the ROLP infection at seedling stage is lethal, but plants can survive when the infection occurs at matured stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since the first recognition of ROLD in 1960, phytoplasma associated with ROLD was widely observed and reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Philippines, China and other Asian countries by the 1980s, which was confirmed by electron microscopy <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</s><s>These did not cause severe problems at that time because diseased rice plants were sporadically found in paddies, despite significant damages and death of infected plants <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, in the decade of the 2010s, ROLD and ROLP 16S rDNA sequences were increasingly reported in China, Thailand, Vietnam, India and the Philippines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, suggesting a global expansion of the disease.</s><s>ROLP is reported to be transmitted by zig-zag leafhopper (ZLH), Recilia dorsalis Motchulsky (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</s><s>This was recently supported by PCR detection of ROLP in field-collected insects in India and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref> and by transmission tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, ROLP transmission by alternative insect vectors (GLH), N. cincticeps and N. virescens, that mainly disperse in temperate and tropic zones, respectively, have been evidenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Given the expansion of ROLD in Asian countries, ROLP is considered as a potential threat to global rice production.</s><s>In Southern China, heavily infested rice fields were found in Guangdong province in 2015, and the disease spread to surrounding areas (Guangxi and Hainan provinces) between 2016 and 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.</s><s>In Thailand, a nation-wide survey was conducted, and it revealed the wide-spread occurrence of ROLD in the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>, and in the Philippines, a recent survey revealed the re-emergence of the disease on different islands <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Although the cases have been reported, the mechanism of ROLP infection in the rice ecosystem and rice plants is largely unknown.</s><s>To understand a part of these, in this study, we conducted a further survey regarding ROLD and the sequencing of ROLP 16S rDNA in three countries-Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia-to understand the genetic variations of global ROLP isolates and their geographic distributions.</s><s>Furthermore, the population density of insect vectors in Cambodian paddies was monitored, and the rate of ROLP acquisition by insects was assessed.</s><s>In addition, altered
