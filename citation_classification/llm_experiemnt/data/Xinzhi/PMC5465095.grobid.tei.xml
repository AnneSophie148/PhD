likelihood of cross-resistance between AfIP-1A/1B and the Cry3Bb1 protein expressed by event MON88017.</s><s>At Rochelle, injury to all four ZmAflP1A/1B events was not significantly different from DAS-59122-7 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), and all 4 events had estimated node-injury scores much lower than the injury observed on the commercial MON88017 line reported above.</s><s>This shows that experimental events with ZmAfIP1A/1B should provide robust efficacy against corn rootworm populations that have developed resistance to the Cry3Bb1 protein <ref

unselected WCR neonates to evaluate impact on root injury to ZmAfIP1A/1B events.</s><s>Non-transgenic maize isolines served as negative controls.</s><s>Consistent with greenhouse and field testing results when compared to isoline maize, ZmAfIP1A/1B events displayed significant protection against feeding by unselected WCR (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>However, Cry34/35-selected WCR

Laboratory-selected WCR confirm similar mode of action of AfIP-1A/1B to Cry34/35 but not to mCry3A.</s><s>Injury from larval feeding to AfIP-1A/1B maize events by Cry34/35-and mCry3A-selected WCR populations was visually assessed using the 0-3 Iowa State node-injury scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Means and 95% confidence intervals followed by different letters within insect populations differed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) by using a linear mixed model.</s><s>observed within the region spanning AfIP-1A Pro46-Ile62 and Cry34Ab1 Thr33-Asn37.</s><s>Cry34Ab1 has a simple four amino acid coiled region connecting β3 and β4 whereas AfIP-1A contains a three residue turn, five residue β strand, and five residue α helix in the structurally equivalent region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>).</s><s>The remaining connecting loops between β strands in the AfIP-1A structure adopt a similar confirmation to those in Cry34Ab1 except for the final glycine-rich connecting loop (residue 128-131) between β10 and β11.</s><s>This loop deviates from that of Cry34Ab1, but this region also has weak electron density.</s><s>As a result the structural differences here may not be significant.</s><s>Overall, the structure of AfIP-1A is quite similar to that of Cry34Ab1 providing some explanation for a similar mode of action between AfIP-1A and Cry34Ab1.</s></p></div>
