<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here, we report a new paratransgenic strategy for control of Xylella transmission by the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> EGFP-expressing P. agglomerans persisted inside the foregut of the glassy-winged sharpshooter.</s><s>(a) GWSS were fed EGFP-expressing P. agglomerans via an artificial feeding system for 48 h.</s><s>The insects were moved to naive grape plant for 24 h to wash out unattached bacteria.</s><s>They were subsequently housed on another naive grape plant for up to 15 days.</s><s>Insects were collected daily, and processed as described.</s><s>Homogenates were plated on LB plates to determine the presence of P. agglomerans.</s><s>(b) Percent of GWSS carrying EGFP-expressing P. agglomerans over a period of 15 days.</s><s>No difference in proportions of GWSS carrying EGFP-expressing P. agglomerans was observed.</s><s>p = 0.1979 by chi-squared test for homogeneity H. vitripennis.</s><s>P. agglomerans E325, an EPA approved agent for biocontrol of certain crop diseases, has been genetically modified using plasmid pT3078, which has the bla gene as a marker, to express recombinant EGFP in the foregut of GWSS.</s><s>We have demonstrated robust EGFP expression in the insect foregut, in the region that harbors the plant pathogen, X. fastidiosa.</s><s>Furthermore, we report the use of a simple and inexpensive microencapsulation strategy to contain engineered Pantoea and release the modified bacteria during conditions of xylem flux into the anterior mouthparts of the feeding insect.</s><s>Our results represent the first iteration of this paratransgenic delivery system.</s><s>Refinement of polymer chemistry and capsule application may increase the percentage of GWSS that acquire transgenic Pantoea in future trials.</s><s>Chemical functionalization of the polymer backbone to enhance bacterial release along with refined methods of increasing bacterial CFUs per capsule are currently underway.</s></p><p><s>We propose the use of an EPA approved biocontrol agent, P. agglomerans E325, as a paratransgenic control vehicle for PD.</s><s>P. agglomerans colonized the foregut of the insect from both an artificial feeding system and plants painted with unencapsulated and encapsulated bacteria.</s><s>P. agglomerans persisted in the insect foregut over the entire duration of testing, up to15 days.</s><s>The 15 -day period is significant since it represents close to Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Bacterial survival under extreme dehydration.</s><s>Encapsulation of P. agglomerans significantly increases bacterial viability compared to unencapsulated controls during desiccating conditions.</s><s>Unencapsulated P. agglomerans died in a week after dehydration, while encapsulated P. agglomerans survived for a month one third of the insect's lifespan.</s><s>Additionally, field applications of this approach could involve bi-weekly delivery of encapsulated bacteria to grape plants, thus offering fresh inocula to GWSS on a regular basis.</s><s>P. agglomerans can be engineered to produce anti-Xylella molecules such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or anti-Xylella antibodies to block X. fastidiosa.</s><s>We have used plasmid pT3078, which has the bla gene as a marker in addition to an EGFP gene.</s><s>However, for field application, Pantoea lines expressing anti-Xylella molecules without Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> P. agglomerans survival after exposure to UVC

antibiotic marker genes will be engineered.</s><s>P. agglomerans lines with fluorophore genes or REDantibody genes as markers are under development for field release.</s><s>These strategies, coupled with a refined delivery system, will produce a robust toolset in the battle against GWSSmediated PD transmission.</s></p><p><s>Field use of paratransgenic control for arthropod-borne diseases remains a future prospect, largely due to concerns about the fate of engineered bacteria.</s><s>In the current model, we believe that environmental risks associated with release of foreign genes will be reduced.</s><s>First, plasmid decay for the recombinant P. agglomerans (Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) occurs at the rate of 0.0533 % per bacterial generation; thus engineered bacteria are expected to revert to wild-type forms.</s><s>Furthermore, engineered P. agglomerans grows at a rate comparable to wild-type counterparts (Additional file 4: Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>), suggesting that it cannot out-compete the native organism.</s><s>Second, we have encased the recombinant symbiont in an alginate particle that inhibits release of payload into the environment.</s><s>Physical contact between engineered bacteria and native bacteria of the rhizosphere or phytosphere is greatly impeded by the presence of capsules.</s><s>Thus horizontal gene transfer between engineered P. agglomerans and commonly present bacteria of environmental consortia -a very rare event that occurs in the 10 -8 to 10 -9 range (data not shown) -should be further diminished.</s><s>The overall aim of this strategy is to reduce horizontal gene transfer to levels that are acceptable to regulatory agencies, rather than eliminating gene flow.</s><s>Abolishing gene flow between environmental bacteria is an unrealistic goal.</s><s>However, by providing a physical barrier via microparticles we can minimize exchange between the large number of freshly released bacteria used in plant inundation and environmental microbes, with the aim of reducing unwanted gene flow.</s></p><p><s>We have contained engineered P. agglomerans using calcium-alginate microparticles.</s><s>To deliver the bacteria to GWSS, we have chosen to paint growing grape shoots, thus facilitating ingestion of the organisms during insect feeding.</s><s>GWSS and other sharpshooters are xylem feeders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>They initially contact a plant surface with the tip of their stylet before penetrating into xylem vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesize that bacteria-laden microparticles that have been painted on plant shoots will contaminate the lumen of the insect's stylet.</s><s>During the sucking of xylem, hydrostatic pressure gradients as high as 0.24 MPa/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, will cause rapid swelling of the alginate hydrogel and release Pantoea into the cibarial region of the sharpshooter's foregut.</s><s>To optimize release of bacteria from the microcapsules and enhance colonization of the insect, hydrogels may be tuned by varying the composition and concentration of divalent cations (Ca ++ , Ba ++ ) as well as alginate (Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Over 80 % of GWSS that were exposed to unencapsulated (naked) Pantoea during feeding became colonized with the bacteria, at a mean CFU value of 245.4 ± 80.4.</s><s>(Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>).</s><s>We tested microparticles containing 1 %, 2 % and 3 % alginate (w/v) in the hydrogel.</s><s>In all cases, there was a significant reduction in Pantoea acquisition when compared to the control group (GWSS exposed to unencapsulated bacteria) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>When an alginate concentration of 1 % (w/v) was used, target GWSS acquired Pantoea at a rate of 51.8 % with a mean CFU count of 186.6 ± 68.9.</s><s>This rate of acquisition was the highest amongst the tested alginate concentrations and we believe that 1 % alginate particles merit further attention.</s><s>Rates of acquisition of encapsulated Pantoea by target GWSS may have been lowered for several reasons.</s><s>First, it is likely that the experimental insects represented a heterogeneous population.</s><s>It is difficult to maintain homogeneous GWSS population under controlled conditions, thus, we used field-collected insects that were previously colonized with environmental bacteria, genetically distinct and of varying ages through the course of the summer.</s><s>Second, we used a very limited time frame for acquisition of bacteria through feeding by GWSS.</s><s>It is likely that future field applications that employ multiple treatments of plants with greatly protracted contact time between GWSS and particles will increase colonization rates in the insect.</s><s>Third, many refinements in particle composition are possible.</s><s>We are exploring use of particles made of other materials that would dissolve in the presence of enzymes present in the insect saliva to better release the bacterial payload.</s><s>Attractants and feeding stimulants may be incorporated to enhance bacterial delivery.</s><s>Indeed, future versions of the microencapsulation-delivery system should result in higher rates of target insect colonization with engineered Pantoea.</s></p><p><s>Microencapsulation is a first step toward addressing concerns associated with paratransgenic manipulation of arthropods.</s><s>In this proof of principle, we deployed microcapsules to deliver a recombinant bacterium to an insect.</s><s>We designed the alginate particles to swell under very high hydrostatic pressures encountered during xylem flux and to decrease contact between engineered bacteria and the environment during periods of application and residence on plants.</s><s>Microencapsulation will decrease direct interactions of released bacteria with other epiphytes when compared to unencapsulated bacteria.</s><s>This should also decrease the interactions of released bacteria with rhizosphere organisms.</s><s>We believe this is a first step toward targeted delivery of recombinant bacteria to arthropod vectors of disease.</s><s>In ongoing projects, we are designing more advanced particles that respond to specific physiological cues within insects, such as pH and blood products, to establish a platform for field use of paratransgenics.</s></p><p><s>Based on this technology, microcapsule-based delivery of transgenic bacteria to arthropods of clinical significance (sand flies, kissing bugs, mosquitoes) for human vector-borne disease prevention becomes a real and logical extension, signifying a paradigm shift in paratransgenic techniques from the lab to field settings.</s><s>A microparticle-based recombinant-bacterial release strategy could make paratransgenic control of Chagas disease and malaria -for which paratrangenic manipulation has been shown to decrease parasite load inside the
