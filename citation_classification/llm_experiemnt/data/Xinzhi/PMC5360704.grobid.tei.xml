<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Efficient movement of viral particles into the vector oocyte is critical for transovarially transmitted viruses, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus enters the oocyte.</s><s>In insect ovaries, the germarium maintains oocyte production and contains germ cells with nuclei of irregular outline <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Swiatek, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Szklarzewicz et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>These germ cells are the initial entry locations for symbiotic bacteria such as Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster and for viral pathogens such as RSV in Laodelphax striatellus <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Huo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Newton et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we characterized the infection route of RGDV to enter the oocyte for transovarial transmission by R. dorsalis vector.</s><s>RGDV initially entered the germ cells in the germarium, moved between follicular cells, then translocated across the microvilli to access the oocyte cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>RGDV, Wolbachia and RSV seem to share a common infection route from the germarium to the oocyte in their respective vectors.</s></p><p><s>At 9 days after insect eclosion, we calculated that RGDV had spread into about 80% of intestines, but only into about 21% of ovaries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>At this time, viruses had abundantly accumulated in the germarium and follicular cells of virus-infected ovaries.</s><s>However, RGDV had successfully entered the mature oocytes from follicular cells in only about one-third of virus-infected ovaries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We thus determined that RGDV encountered strong membrane or tissues barriers in its spread paths from the hemocoel to the ovary germarium, then to the follicular cells and finally into the oocytes.</s></p><p><s>Previously, we have shown that tubules induced by plant reoviruses, such as southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) and RDV, can exploit ABTM to spread across the midgut tissues of their insect vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jia et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wei and Li, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we found that RGDV can exploit Pns11 tubules carrying viral particles to traverse the actin-based junctions between follicular cells or directly pass through the actin-based microvilli from follicular cells to oocyte cytoplasm of insect vectors (Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>We previously used an RNAi strategy to specifically knock down the expression of Pns11 by treatment with dsPns11; the tubules failed to assemble, and viral spread was prevented among cultured insect vector cells without significant effects on viral multiplication <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we further determined that the failure of Pns11 tubule assembly after treatment with dsPns11 significantly inhibited viral entry into the oocyte and thus transovarial transmission by insect vectors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s><s>Because RGDV exploited Pns11 tubules to spread from initially infected regions in virus-infected ovaries, it was reasonable that the treatment dsPns11 would significantly reduce viral accumulation.</s><s>Based on these results, we deduced that virus-induced tubule acted as a vehicle for spread of RGDV into ovary oocyte cells.</s><s>Furthermore, we found Pns11 can specifically interact with actin, the main component of ovary junctions or microvilli, in vivo or in vitro (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>We thus predicted that Pns11 tubules may be propelled by ABTM to overcome the tissue barriers of actin-based cellular junctions or microvilli of the ovary, finally facilitating viruses to overcome transovarial transmission.</s><s>Thus, ABTM may be an efficient and common mechanism for plant reoviruses to overcome membrane or tissue barriers within insect vectors.</s></p><p><s>Whether other insect factors are involved in the ABTMmediated transovarial transmission of RGDV in its insect vector is still unknown.</s><s>Recently, we report that Pns10 of RDV, the functional counterpart of Pns11 of RGDV, can specifically interact with actin, tropomoduli, myosin, Vg, and lipophorin precursor of insect vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., , 2017))</ref>.</s><s>Vg is a major yolk protein precursor in insects for the developing oocytes to meet the nutrient requirements during egg development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Generally, this female-specific protein also crosses the junctions between follicular cells and is taken up into the oocyte through the microvilli <ref type="bibr">(Tufail and</ref><ref type="bibr">Takeda, 2008, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we predict that Vg may be involved in the ABTM-mediated transport of Pns11 tubules of RGDV between follicular cells or into the oocyte cytoplasm.</s><s>Previous data has shown that an endogenous retrovirus of D. melanogaster, ZAM, is transmitted from follicular cells to the oocyte by making use of the endogenous endocytic yolk uptake mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brasset et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, the outer capsid protein of RSV can interact with Vg and use Vg as a vehicle to enter the vector oocyte <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Huo et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It will be interesting to investigate whether Vg-mediated viral entry into the oocyte is a common mechanism of transovarial transmission.</s></p><p><s>Previously, we have shown that the infection of RGDV directly affects the viability and development of its vector offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lan et al., 2016)</ref>, suggesting that RGDV is harmful to the early insect embryo.</s><s>Our current study showed that the infection of RGDV induced viroplasm formation due to nonstructural protein Pns9 in the oocyte cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Viroplasm of plant reovirus is the site for viral replication and assembly of progeny virions in insect vectors or plant hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wei and Li, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>We thus determined that propagation of RGDV in the early insect embryo may directly cause cytopathologic changes or damage functionally relevant tissues, decreasing the fitness of insect offspring, similar to the cytopathological changes that the plant reoviruses caused in the insect midgut and salivary glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wei and Li, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, the replication of RGDV can induce small interfering RNA antiviral immunity responses in the oocyte cytoplasm, which may also be compensated by the fitness of insect offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lan et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Many arboviruses such as Dengue and Zika viruses can be vertically transmitted by insect vectors such as mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lequime and Lambrechts, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grunnill and Boots, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Thangamani et al., 2016)</ref>, but the mechanism is unclear.</s><s>Because almost all arboviruses can replicate and induce viral inclusions in respective insect vectors, our current model that the utilization of virus-induced inclusions for viral spread through insect oocyte cytoplasm by RGDV would be extensively exploited by arboviruses, opening new perspectives for viral control.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1
