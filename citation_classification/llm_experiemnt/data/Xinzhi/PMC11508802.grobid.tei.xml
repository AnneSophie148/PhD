<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The diets of insects can offer insight into their feeding habits and movement patterns, which can be of use for invasive species and pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as well as for biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> studies.</s><s>Dietary analysis can be performed via DNA metabarcoding, which involves PCR amplification of target DNA from a taxonomic group of interest (e.g., plants for herbivorous insects), followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing of PCR products and comparison to an appropriate reference database.</s><s>While this approach can allow the identification of DNA in gut contents, care must be taken that the DNA originates in the gut and not from the surface of the insect.</s><s>This is less of an issue with predatory arthropods, where other animals are consumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but plant DNA (in the form of pollen) is widespread in the environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, where non-predatory insects are the focus of an insect diet study, it is a necessary step to mitigate the amount of surface-level contamination so that clear conclusions can be drawn about what the insect was feeding upon, as opposed to what external material it had come into contact with.</s><s>There are a number of documented methods available in the literature that state they have successfully resolved the problem of external contamination of herbivorous insects with plant DNA.</s><s>Cooper et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> found that submerging insects in ethanol (70%) and bleach (0.5%), separated by rinses of deionised water, resulted in successful amplification of plant DNA that was assumed to be ingested material.</s><s>Building upon Cooper's method, Avanesyan and Lamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> submerged Lycorma delicatula nymphs in a 2% bleach solution and inferred that the recovered DNA was from ingested material.</s><s>Similarly, Wallinger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found that bathing wireworms in 1-1.5% bleach was enough to remove artificially introduced surface contamination.</s><s>However, the effectiveness of these approaches has not always been rigorously assessed and may not reflect real-world surface contaminants.</s><s>Linville and Wells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> observed that soaking carnivorous maggots in bleach (20%) removed surface contamination whilst keeping the ingested material intact.</s><s>This study was based on the use of Sanger sequencing, which may not pick up low-level contamination of the external spike into the gut contents.</s></p><p><s>We report the effectiveness of surface-contaminant removal techniques on Philaenus spumarius, the Meadow Spittlebug, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) as a means to identify plant material.</s><s>We selected P. spumarius as our insect of interest, largely due to its ability to act as a vector for the transmission of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The identification of the feeding range of P. spumarius from ingested material would enable the targeted screening of plants, potentially resulting in the early detection of infected material.</s><s>The detection of gut content DNA in P. spumarius is likely to be challenging, as this is a xylem-feeding insect that ingests xylem sap through a stylet inserted into the xylem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and low amounts of host DNA are likely to be present in the xylem.</s></p><p><s>In this study, our initial aim was to use HTS to identify the gut contents of P. spumarius.</s><s>The results of this initial experiment led to further work to evaluate more rigorous surfacecontaminant removal techniques, to evaluate gut dissection and Distel sterilisation, and to report on the potential of ultraviolet (UV) light sterilisation.</s><s>The work presented here therefore comprises a series of complementary but separate experiments.</s></p><p><s>Experiment 1 was contamination baselining.</s><s>Metabarcoding was performed for gut content analysis of whole and parts of caged spittlebugs, using a published surface sterilisation method.</s><s>We made use of a captive population of spittlebugs with a known, limited diet in order to confirm the functioning of the method.</s><s>Our hypothesis was that we would be able to detect plant DNA in spittlebug samples originating from the food plants inside the cages.</s><s>Experiment 2 was Tween and bleach sterilisation.</s><s>This was an assessment of two further surface sterilisation techniques, using qPCR and metabarcoding of spittlebugs spiked with pollen.</s><s>Our hypothesis was that the Tween and bleach sterilisation techniques would reduce detectable pollen to the level of the unspiked controls.</s><s>Experiment 3 was gut dissection and Distel sterilisation to control surface contamination.</s><s>This included the assessment of the excision and testing of spittlebug guts, as well as treatment with Distel, using metabarcoding of spittlebugs spiked with pollen.</s><s>Our hypothesis was that the gut dissection and/or Distel treatment techniques would reduce detectable pollen to the level of the unspiked controls.</s><s>Experiment 4 was UV sterilisation.</s><s>This involved using qPCR to assess of the ability of ultraviolet light to destroy the DNA present in pollen.</s><s>Our hypothesis was that UV treatment of pollen would render us unable to detect plant DNA using qPCR.</s></p><p><s>After detecting DNA in the first experiment that was inconsistent with the plants present in the controlled environment of the cages, we hypothesised that this was likely due to the presence of DNA from external sources in the form of pollen.</s><s>We then designed the three subsequent experiments to try and identify a method to satisfactorily remove DNA from pollen on the exterior of the insects, allowing gut contents to be unambiguously identified.</s></p></div>

using DNA metabarcoding.</s><s>Had this proved successful, the method would have been appropriate to roll out to wild-caught individuals to investigate the diet of P. spumarius.</s><s>Indeed, the results for experiment 1 (and subsequently experiment 3) gave superficially plausible results, suggesting that, within the cages, the primary diet was broad bean, with occasional feeding on other plant species.</s><s>However, both experiments were undertaken in rearing cages that contained either plants of broad bean only or plants of broad bean, lavender, and rosemary.</s><s>The presence of plant DNA from species not found in the cages strongly suggested environmental contamination.</s><s>These species were identified in two independent experiments (1 and 3) using different sequencing technologies-making these likely to be real observations as opposed to sequencing artifacts-and are highly likely to represent environmental contamination.</s><s>We are confident the results are not laboratory-introduced contamination because the negative controls contained very low amounts of DNA and were removed after quality control steps due to low read counts.</s><s>The contaminants identified have overlapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> pollen seasons, and we propose that surface contamination in the samples originates from pollen.</s><s>Banana was identified in the initial experiment and additionally in a single sample in experiment 3.</s><s>For all the experiments presented here, the number of samples analysed is low.</s><s>Nevertheless, because we observe positive evidence of pollen DNA carryover after the various treatments, even with small sample numbers, the results are still informative observations.</s><s>Designing a statistically robust assessment of these effects would be a worthwhile future endeavour.</s><s>Dietary analysis of plant-feeding insects relies on successfully eliminating surface contamination.</s><s>If this cannot be performed reliably, then it will not be possible to differentiate between plants that the insect is feeding on and plants the insect has been in contact with.</s><s>Pollen is likely to be of particular concern, as it has a robust outer coating that resists simple decontamination processes, and some pollen types (notably pollen from insect-pollenated plants) are sticky and will adhere to insects.</s><s>Moreover, pollen is known to travel large distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, so contamination is not necessarily reflective of an insect's local environment.</s><s>In the absence of adequate controls, these contamination events can seem to be biologically plausible dietary results.</s></p><p><s>Our results assume that the majority of surface contamination observed originates from pollen adhering to the surface of P. spumarius.</s><s>Based on the results of our initial experiment (experiment 1), we designed a series of further experiments (experiments 2, 3, and 4) to try and develop a method to remove pollen from insects or render pollen DNA undetectable by qPCR.</s><s>Due to the seasonal availability of different pollen types and our desire to coat insects with pollen from species they were highly unlikely to have encountered, we used a variety of different pollen types in our experiments.</s><s>We were able to confirm that pollen will persist on the surface despite following both procedures outlined in Cooper et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and with the use of products such as Distel (experiment 3).</s><s>The results from experiment 3 show that no plant material was identified from any replicate of the gut-dissected control group, suggesting that any plant material ingested by P. spumarius remains below the limit of detection for this method.</s><s>As P. spumarius is a xylem feeder, we hypothesise that only a small amount of plant material is ingested upon the initial piercing of the plant cells, which is quickly degraded in the stomach of the insect.</s><s>Indeed, the low levels of DNA in the stomach contents were confirmed in another P. spumarius-based study <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of plant DNA is supported by the results of experiment 2-a more rigorous sterilisation procedure using Tween and bleach results in no detectable plant DNA.</s><s>This result could be a 'true' result-no plant DNA was recovered from the gut as it was absent-or it could be the complete destruction or fragmentation of recoverable plant DNA.</s><s>We note that the use of Distel did reduce the levels of pollen material identified from 91-99% in the controls to 40-55% (in experiment 3).</s></p><p><s>Experiment 3 highlights the issue of laboratory contamination when dealing with such sensitive methods, especially when dealing with a sample type as adhesive as pollen.</s><s>Two sample types that were not dusted with tulip pollen were found to contain tulip pollen sequences.</s><s>However, the tulip-dusted samples could still be differentiated from the non-dusted samples due to the lower levels of tulip present (both in the absolute reads and as a proportion of the total abundance).</s><s>More specifically, (A) the number of replicates positive for tulip pollen was three out of three for every pollen-dusted sample, but lower in the non-dusted samples (none for two sample types, one out of three for one sample type, two out of three for one sample type); (B) the number of tulip reads was lower in the non-dusted samples than in the dusted samples; the contaminated, non-dusted samples had an average of 6711 tulip reads, the pollen-dusted samples had an average of 154,440 tulip reads, and the Distel-treated, pollen-dusted samples had an average of 48,860 tulip reads; and (C) the proportion of tulip reads is lower in the non-dusted samples than in the dusted samples: the sequences of the contaminated, non-dusted samples were between 2 and 9% tulip; the sequences of the dusted samples were between 92 and 100% tulip; and the sequences of the Distel-treated dusted samples were between 41 and 55% tulip (see Supplementary Materials S1, E3-Matrix).</s><s>We therefore believe that the tulip sequences present on the tulip-dusted sample types are reflective of an inability to remove the tulip pollen rather than being laboratory contaminants.</s><s>As such, these results are still informative.</s></p><p><s>Existing studies state that their proposed sterilisation techniques produce satisfactory results.</s><s>However, some of these studies have been tested on dead plant material (chopped roots) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or non-plant material (blood) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which do not possess the adhesive properties or robustness of pollen.</s><s>In some instances, bleach washes would most likely remove enough surface contamination to yield positive results but did not monitor for all environmental contaminants.</s><s>Previous studies have investigated the detectability of pollen DNA in arthropod washing liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, but the work presented here has the advantage of using artificially dosed pollen and, therefore, has the ability to detect pollen retained on an insect's surface after washing.</s><s>The pollen-dusting approach used may introduce pollen at higher levels than would be expected in nature, so future work could include an assessment of sterilisation approaches at lower levels of pollen contamination.</s><s>However, given a lack of a priori knowledge of the external pollen contamination of any wild-caught insect that would eventually be the target of a gut content analysis, it is preferable to have a method that can remove external pollen at the highest levels of contamination.</s></p><p><s>In summary, despite the plausible results from the initial experiment (detection of DNA from the plant species that the insects were feeding on), we found we could not remove surface contamination from the insect while retaining signal from the guts.</s><s>Our results demonstrate the great difficulty of removing external contamination, particularly involving pollen, and in these instances, the efficacy of surface sterilisation methods should be demonstrated.</s><s>For studies where the presence of contamination will have an impact on the output, great care should be taken when interpreting the results of studies that do not use surface sterilisation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) or that use the methods that we have assessed here.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>16
