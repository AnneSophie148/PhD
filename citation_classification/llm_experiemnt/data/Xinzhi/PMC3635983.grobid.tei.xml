<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Huanglongbing (HLB) is considered a devastating citrus disease and affects most of the main citrus growing areas worldwide.</s><s>It has become a serious threat to Brazil and USA, the largest producers of sweet orange and frozen concentrated orange juice, since the first reports of the disease in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, respectively.</s><s>In Brazil, the causal agents of HLB are the Gram-negative and phloemrestricted bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas) and Ca.</s><s>L. americanus (CaLam).</s><s>Another species, Ca.</s><s>L. africanus (CaLaf), occurs in Africa and is not found in South, Central or North America.</s><s>Both CaLas and CaLam are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri); however, they can also be transmitted with different levels of efficiency by grafting of infected tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Once a citrus tree is infected, the time taken for HLB symptoms to appear varies according to the genotype; the physiological stage and age of the plant; the tissue used as the source of bacteria or the intensity of inoculation by the psyllid; and the season of the year.</s><s>In leaves, typical symptoms include yellowing, asymmetric blotchy mottling and nutrient deficiency.</s><s>Small, poor quality and lopsided fruits are frequently observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>There is a clear disturbance of the transport system between source (leaves) and sinks (meristems, fruits, roots), with starch accumulation in plastids, chloroplast disruption, necrotic phloem (probably associated with plugging of sieve cells via callose deposition) and phloem-proteins accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Ultrastructural changes in the phloem and adjacent tissues can be observed in plants infected with CaLas, from the early (asymptomatic) stages of infection (three months), progressing to phloem degeneration nine months later <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>However, before the complete degeneration of the phloem vessels, the bacteria move to newly growing tissues to restart the infection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Compared with CaLas, CaLam is less effectively transmitted both by vector and by grafting, is more sensitive to higher temperatures and reaches lower titer levels under the same experimental conditions.</s><s>Both bacteria induce indistinguishable HLB symptoms in susceptible genotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Using two different metagenomic approaches, two research groups reported the full genome of CaLas <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>The authors showed that the bacterium has a small (1.23 Mb) genome, limited capacity for aerobic respiration and depends on several primary metabolites.</s><s>It lacks type III and type IV secretion systems, avirulence factors, and degradative enzymes, which probably avoid the elicitation of defense response based on the products of plant cell wall degradation.</s><s>However, the authors did not discount the possibility that CaLas may elicit a plant response mediated by a pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and/or secrete an unknown effector that suppresses the host defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, together with the absence of important housekeeping genes associated with the difficulty to culture the bacterium in artificial medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, its capacity to multiply both in plants and insects, and its intracellular habitat in the phloem sieve tubes suggest a parasitic, rather than a pathogenic, lifestyle.</s><s>Additionally, two highly related, circular prophages have been found integrated into the CaLas genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>One of them, SC1, is apparently fully functional, with a lytic cycle that appears to be activated in plants, but not in psyllids.</s><s>The other prophage, SC2, is apparently in the lysogenic phase both in plants and psyllid infected by CaLas.</s><s>Whether or not the CaLas prophages play a direct role in its competitiveness with CaLam remains to be determined; however, <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al.</ref> suggested that this possibility could not be ruled out <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these features clearly suggest an improved fitness of CaLas when compared with CaLam, and may explain why, in recent years, this species has become prevalent in Brazil.</s><s>Nevertheless, CaLam is still found in the field and there is at least one report of this species in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several studies on the transcriptional response of citrus plants showing HLB symptoms have been reported; however, all of them focused on CaLas infection.</s><s>Overall, they show complex gene expression modulation in response to CaLas, but no specific mechanism associated with the infection has been identified yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that the studies have focused on CaLas because of its worldwide importance; however, finding common features -and differences -between the two species, and differences in the response of citrus to them, may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HLB and how citrus plants respond to the disease.</s><s>The present study evaluated the transcriptional reprogramming of leaf tissue of sweet orange during the symptomatic stage of infection with CaLam, using a robust, customized, 385K-microarray chip containing approximately 32,000 unigenes from Citrus sinensis L. Osb.</s><s>A set of candidate genes from this and from previous studies was used to validate the expression profile in symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-positive leaf tissue of sweet orange infected with CaLas or CaLam.</s><s>Based on these results, we described the main alterations in gene expression during the late stages of infection of CaLam compared with CaLas and discussed how this information could be useful for genetic engineering to control HLB.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of changes in gene expression in response to CaLam infection</head><p><s>Microarray analysis identified 633 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam: 418 of them (66%) were upregulated and 215 (34%) were downregulated (p-values ≤0.05, fold change |FC| ≥ 2.0 and odds probability ≥ 0.95).</s><s>Among these DEGs, 514 (81%) were identified as orthologs of A. thaliana genes (Additional file 1).</s><s>Although microarray experiments were performed using only two replicates, correlations within groups were very high (approximately 97% for both symptomatic and controls).</s><s>To determine which genes and pathways were relevant during the symptomatic stage of CaLam infection, a GSEA approach was used.</s><s>Based on GSEA, a hypergeometric test (p-values &lt;0.005) was applied to identify which cellular components (CCs), molecular functions (MFs) and biological processes (BPs) were overrepresented in our ordered list of DEGs.</s></p><p><s>GSEA revealed many DEGs putatively associated with the endomembrane system, apoplast and chloroplasts (Additional file 2).</s><s>These genes were mainly involved with the photosynthetic apparatus and the expression level of many of them was downregulated in symptomatic plants compared with control plants.</s><s>Among the genes associated with the endomembrane system, transcripts encoding three zinc transporters (ZIP1, ZIP4 and ZIP5) and a zinc inducer facilitator (ZIF1), which is involved in Zn homeostasis and Zn sequestration, were upregulated.</s></p><p><s>With regard to MFs, the DEGs were mainly associated with catalytic activity, transcription regulation and transport of specific substrates and metabolites (Additional file 2).</s><s>In addition to the Zn transporters, several transcripts encoding auxin transporters were differentially expressed in symptomatic plants compared with control plants.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, GSEA revealed significant BPs altered in symptomatic plants upon infection with CaLam.</s><s>We found that many BPs related to hormone signaling and metabolism, stress response, photosynthesis, secondary metabolism and transcription were overrepresented by GSEA.</s><s>Moreover, several specific BPs associated with defense against biotic stress, such as immune response, incompatible interactions, systemic acquired resistance, oxidative stress and response to bacteria were identified (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>A complete list of DEGs selected from the enrichment analyses can be found in Additional files 3 and 4.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genes involved with phloem functionality and callose deposition</head><p><s>CaLam infection modulated several genes with important functions in the phloem (Additional file 1).</s><s>Among the induced transcripts, we found those encoding a phloem protein-2 (PP2-B10), a PP2-B14 and a homogentisate phytyltransferase (VTE2); the latter is involved in tocopherol biosynthesis and phloem sucrose loading.</s><s>Moreover, a transcript encoding a cytochrome P450 (CYP83B1), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and defense response by callose deposition, was also upregulated in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcription factors (TF)</head><p><s>Reprogramming of gene expression upon CaLam infection is regulated by many transcription factors.</s><s>Among the 38 differentially expressed transcription factors, MYB, ethylene response factors (ERF), bHLH and WRKY family proteins were the most abundant.</s><s>A myb-like gene transcript was the most induced transcription factor: it was approximately 100-fold upregulated in symptomatic compared to control plants (Additional file 1).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary metabolism</head><p><s>Among the most relevant BPs identified in GSEA were those related to secondary metabolic processes, phenylpropanoid biosynthetic processes and biosynthesis and metabolism of flavonoids and indole glucosinolates.</s><s>Among the differentially expressed genes, transcripts encoding three oxidorreductase 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenases were upregulated.</s><s>Other differentially modulated transcripts in symptomatic citrus that are related to secondary metabolism are listed in Additional files 3 and 4.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to validate candidate genes</head><p><s>Before RT-qPCR analysis, we tested the expression stability of ten reference genes (F-box, TBP2, PTB1, Importin, 18S ribosomal, EF1α, SAND, GAPDH, DIM1 and TIP41) to find the best pair of genes for normalizing the expression levels of the candidate genes.</s><s>Using geNorm, we defined PTB1 and GAPDH as the most stable pair of reference genes for RT-qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Pairwise variation analysis revealed that PTB1 and GAPDH should be sufficient for a reliable normalization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Among the 20 genes tested by RT-qPCR, transcripts for eight and five genes were statistically differentially expressed only in leaves challenged with CaLam and CaLas in relation to their controls, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Additional file 5).</s><s>Transcripts for five genes were differentially modulated either in response to CaLam or to CaLas challenging.</s><s>Four of them (GPT2, miraculin,  PP2-B15 and PR6) were upregulated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), whereas transcripts for NADPH/ RbohD were downregulated in comparison with controls when assayed by RT-qPCR (Additional file 5).</s><s>Two gene transcripts (SABP3 and USP) showed a non-statistically significant trend for differential modulation in symptomatic or asymptomatic leaves (both infected with CaLam or CaLas) in relation to the control, according to the RT-qPCR assays (Additional file 5).</s><s>These results differed from those obtained by the microarray, in which transcripts for a SABP3 gene were downregulated, whereas transcripts for USP were slightly induced during the symptomatic phase of CaLam infection compared with the control.</s><s>In terms of the differential expression during the asymptomatic or symptomatic stage of infection, some differences were found depending on the bacterium species used.</s><s>In general, few genes expressions were differentially modulated during the asymptomatic phase of CaLam or CaLas infection.</s><s>In the asymptomatic leaves infected with CaLam, the expression of two genes (auxin efflux carrier and VTE2) were induced and repressed, respectively, compared with the control (Additional file 5).</s></p><p><s>During the symptomatic phase of CaLam infection, transcripts for 12 genes were differentially expressed: auxin efflux carrier, PP2-B10, RLP7 and Kunitz family protein (Additional file 5); CSD2, GPT2, miraculin, NADPH/RbohD, NDR1/HIN1-like 3, PP2-B15, PR6 and starch synthase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Among these 12 gene transcripts, nine of them showed similar expression patterns by RT-qPCR compared with the microarray: starch synthase, CSD2, GPT2, Kunitz family protein, NDR1/HIN1like 3 and PR6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and PP2-B10, RLP7 and auxin efflux carrier (Additional file 5).</s><s>Transcripts for a homogentisate phytyltransferase (VTE2) showed a significant reduction in expression only in asymptomatic compared to control plants (Additional file 5) and transcripts for a NADPH/ RbohD, whose expression was observed to slightly increase in the microarray analysis, showed a decrease in expression level when assayed by RT-qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The phloem-protein B15 (PP2-B15), which is reported as one of the most upregulated genes in response to CaLas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, also showed a progressive increase in expression in asymptomatic and symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam.</s><s>Unlike CaLam, the expression of six genes was altered during the asymptomatic phase of CaLas infection: GPT2, miraculin, CERK1, PP2-B15, PR6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and WRKY70 (Additional file 5).</s><s>Three of them were also differentially expressed in symptomatic leaves: GPT2, PP2-B15 and PR6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, transcripts for NADPH/RbohD, oxidorreductases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), WRKY25 and PR1 (Additional file 5), were differentially expressed only during the symptomatic stage of CaLas infection.</s><s>Discrepancies between the expression levels of DEGs identified in the microarray and by RT-qPCR could be related to technical differences in the sensitivity and specificity between the methods, and biological variations, i.e., differences between the genotypes used.</s></p></div>
