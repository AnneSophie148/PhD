<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This first detailed investigation of S. barberi predation against D. citri demonstrates the aggressive feeding behavior of this predator on psyllid eggs and nymphs.</s><s>Sympherobius barberi were effective in consuming all the three life stages including, eggs, small nymphs, and large nymphs of D. citri under both light and dark conditions.</s><s>There was a gradual increase in consumption rate over time, which was more evident for eggs (40 to 95% from 6 to 24 h) and large nymphs (60 to 95% from 6 to 24 h), while 95% of the small nymphs were consumed within 6 h.</s><s>The feeding on eggs was initially low and improved over time, probably due to the concealed locations where they were laid, such as newly developing unfolded leaves and predator ability to reach into those locations.</s><s>For large size predators such as lacewings and ladybeetles, it is difficult to attack prey in such locations, and therefore smaller predators such as predatory mites are more useful to attack eggs and neonates in such locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Juan-Blasco et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The difference of 35% in the consumption rate on small and large nymphs observed at 6 h was reduced to 5-10% within 12-24 h, suggesting that predator will most likely be negatively impacting significant nymphal populations encountered under field conditions.</s><s>The predator preference of prey type or stage is reported for other lacewing species and pests and could impact predation rates in the field.</s><s>For example, when all instars of pea aphid were presented in equal numbers to Tasmanian lacewing Micromus tasmaniae adults, they killed 74-90% of the first instars, 9-26% of second instars but none of the instar third and fourth <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Leathwick, 1989)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Islam and Chapman (2001)</ref> observed predation rate of 10 Forty-eight-hour old adults were separated by distinguishing their genital characters to establish male and female pairs.</s><s>Means with the same letters within a column are not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05).</s><s>Brevicoryne brassicae aphids per day by the larval stage of brown lacewing Micromus tasmaniae, which is half of the predation rate of adult S. barberi on D. citri nymphs in the present study, suggesting better prey suitability for the predator in the latter scenario.</s><s>However, the consumption rate by larvae of S. fallax on nymphal stages of a mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus, was higher in another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Gillani et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>We tested S. barberi against D. citri in two age groups.</s><s>The successful feeding on young and mature nymphs containing 2-3 instar and 4-5 instar, respectively, followed by the experiment showing successful larval development in a diet of mixed instars indicate that they will be able to feed across all instars.</s><s>Additionally, the developing colonies of D. citri nymphs in the field contain multiple instars which provide S. barberi enough choices to reduce pest population.</s><s>In some situations, citrus shoots get colonized by more than one pest such as aphids and psyllids, and therefore, testing prey preference between species will be another interesting subject for a future investigation.</s><s>Larval survival of S. barberi to pupation on the diet of D. citri nymphs averaged 70% compared with 100% on the diet of frozen eggs of E. kuehniella.</s><s>The larval development prolonged on the diet of D. citri nymphs compared to E. kuehniella eggs.</s><s>The Ephestia eggs is a typical diet used for commercial rearing of several predators, which support maximum survival in most cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Qureshi and Stansly, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Khan et al., 2016)</ref>, whereas D. citri was a new prey for the S. barberi.</s><s>The presence of wing buds in the late instars nymphs of D. citri may have caused some deterrence for the S. barberi larvae and reduced the consumable body contents resulting in predator spending more time and energy in handling nymphs thus prolonged development and reduced survival in some cases.</s><s>However, the pupation time of S. barberi did not differ between the diets of D. citri and E. kuehniella, and survival was 100% on both diets.</s><s>The total development time from egg hatch to adult emergence was 26-28 days for S. barberi in the present study.</s><s>Pacheco-Rueda et al. (2011) reported similar development time for this predator on the diet of Dactylopius opuntiae.</s><s>Lara and Perioto (2003) reported that several species of hemerobiids complete their life cycle in 23-40 days at 23 • C, and Vargas (2007) stated 23 days life cycle for Chrysoperla carnea at 26</s></p><p><s>• .</s><s>The survival rate of 70% on D. citri in the present study was better than some much lower rates reported for other Hemerobiids such as 2-25% for M. tasmaniae <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Syrett and Penman, 1981)</ref>, and 30% for Hemerobius pacificus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Neuenschwander, 1975)</ref> which most likely were impacted by rearing conditions including prey, condensation, and cannibalism.</s><s>When reared individually, as in the present study, the survival of M. tasmaniae was in the range of 83-100% <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Leathwick, 1989)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pacheco-Rueda et al. ( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>) observed an average adult longevity of 39 days for S. barberi on the diet of Dactylopius opuntiae and average of 1.89 eggs per day per female.</s><s>In the present study, S. barberi adults evaluated in the two experiments lived between 13 and 19 days, on the diet of D. citri, and female produced an average of 25 eggs during a 3-week period, the latter not very different from the previous study.</s><s>The difference in longevity may be due to the differences in prey and experiment conditions.</s><s>The 65% of the eggs produced by S. barberi on the D. citri diet were fertile, suggesting suitability of psyllid for the successful reproductive performance of this predator.</s></p><p><s>Sympherobius barberi negatively impacted D. citri by providing significant reduction in the psyllid populations on infested orange jasmine plants under semi-natural conditions in the screenhouse and on infested citrus trees in the field.</s><s>Reduction of 43-81% in the eggs and nymphs was observed when S. barberi were released at the rate of 2-6 adults with 100 or fewer eggs or nymphs of D. citri per cage.</s><s>There also was a trend of increased reduction in D. citri with an increase in the release rate of S. barberi.</s><s>In the field conditions, one adult caged with an average of 28-32 nymphs provided a reduction of 35%.</s><s>The evidence of S. barberi feeding, development, and reproduction on D. citri and negative impact on psyllid populations under semi-natural conditions suggest that this species may play a significant role as a predator of D. citri.</s><s>However, open releases and evaluations are needed in the groves.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Legaspi et al. (1996)</ref> investigated the field release of Chrysoperla rufilabris in the large field cages in watermelon fields using densities of 10, 25, and 50 larvae per cage.</s><s>They reported approximately 35% more whiteflies in control with no release over the entire season as compared to the predator treatment with the highest whitefly counts.</s><s>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Daane et al. (1993)</ref> observed a 35% reduction of leafhopper Erythroneura variabilis in the vineyard fields with the release of different species of lacewings.</s><s>Sympherobius barberi like other lacewings attacks many pests, some of which such as whiteflies, aphids etc are found in multiple crops and may help support the establishment of this predator.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Abdominal terminallia of S. barberi, Male: (A) and Female: (B).</s><s>Male and female pairs for reproduction tests were separated by distinguishing genital appendages morphologically, using 14X triplet hasting magnification hand lens.</s><s>Male (A) has flattened shaped terminalia with two claws, while Female (B) has tipped end with two knobs.</s><s>Slide photos were taken by using Olympus SZX16 stereo microscope fixed with DP21 digital camera.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,53.27,69.02,228.00,107.94" type="bitmap" /></figure>
