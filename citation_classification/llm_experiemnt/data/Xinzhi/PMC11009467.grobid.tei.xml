type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>They produce and accumulate various defense-related metabolites in response to the attacks by these organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Among the various metabolites, herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) aid in host defense by acting directly against the herbivores or by attracting herbivores' natural enemies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Progress in analytical techniques has led to identifying diverse volatiles with significant roles in plant protection <ref

(TMTT), a C 16 homoterpene, and (E)-4,8dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), the C 11 analog, have been identified as the predominant ones emitted by plants following herbivory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Both of these irregular acyclic terpenes are common f loral scent compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Like all HIPVs, TMTT and DMNT are known to act directly or indirectly on herbivores.</s><s>In Arabidopsis thaliana, TMTT released after Pieris rapae attack attracts the parasitoid wasp Cotesia rubecula, which is a natural enemy of the pest <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) infested by the bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and the mirid bug Apolygus lucorum releases both TMTT and DMNT, which attract their natural enemies, Microplitis mediator and Peristenus spretus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, TMTT in maize is known to strongly repel the streak virus vector, Cicadulina storeyi, whereas both TMTT and DMNT in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) repel the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Besides, Jing et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> showed that jasmonic acid (JA) application in tea (Camellia sinensis) induces the emission of DMNT, which enhances the resistance of neighboring tea plants to herbivore attack.</s><s>These earlier studies demonstrated the crucial roles of TMTT and DMNT in protecting plants from insects and attracting the natural enemies of insect pests.</s><s>However, reports on the role of these HIPVs in citrus are rare.</s></p><p><s>Citrus is a fruit crop widely grown and consumed around the world.</s><s>One of the most devastating diseases in citrus is huanglongbing (HLB), caused by the bacterial species Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas).</s><s>The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri is known to transmit the HLB-associated bacterial species CLas <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, currently there is no effective measure to control HLB.</s><s>Previous studies on the volatiles of a few horticultural crops demonstrated that Anacardium occidentale contained high levels of DMNT and TMTT, which were not preferred by ACP in behavioral assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>This observation suggested that the homoterpenes DMNT and TMTT do not attract ACP.</s><s>Therefore, using semiochemicals, such as DMNT and TMTT, to manage the behavior of the bacterial carrier or vector spreading HLB seems like a promising strategy to protect citrus plants.</s></p><p><s>Research has demonstrated that AtCYP82G1, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) isolated from A. thaliana, participates in TMTT and DMNT biosynthetic pathways, using (E,E)-geranyllinalool and (E)nerolidol as the substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>However, the role of the CYP genes in regulating the synthesis of TMTT and DMNT in citrus and the inf luence of these compounds on male or female D. citri remain unclear.</s><s>Recently, we found that ACP infestation upregulated two CYP genes of C. sinensis, CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, their functions in the citrus defense system have not been explored.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the present study explored the components of the TMTT and DMNT biosynthetic pathways and analyzed their exact functions in citrus.</s><s>We first analyzed DMNT and TMTT emissions from ACP-infested citrus plants by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and determined the transcript abundance of CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 in the citrus tissues after ACP infestation and in response to mechanical damage and phytohormone treatment by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).</s><s>We further measured CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 activities after expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and citrus calluses by applying solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and GC-MS and validated their roles in homoterpene metabolism.</s><s>Furthermore, to explore the functions, we examined the preference of ACPs for the CsCYP82L1-overexpressing plant and the wild-type (WT) plant and the inf luence of pure TMTT and DMNT on ACPs in a behavioral bioassay using a Y-tube olfactometer.</s><s>Finally, we investigated the role of a transcription factor (CsERF017) in activating CsCYP82L1 using the yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), tobacco transient dual luciferase assay, and lemon leaf transient expression.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subcellular localization of CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2</head><p><s>Protein localization in a cell helps predict its in vivo functions.</s><s>In this study, we introduced the green f luorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs of the two CYPs separately into protoplasts obtained from Arabidopsis mesophyll cells, using an empty GFP vector as a control, and analyzed the location.</s><s>The signal due to the empty GFP vector was detected in the cytosol and the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 fused with GFP were co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-localization signal peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>These data suggested that CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 are mainly localized to the ER membrane.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro activity of CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 enzymes</head><p><s>To further verify whether CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 participate in synthesizing TMTT and DMNT, we assessed the activity of CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 enzymes in yeast cells with exogenously added (E,E)-geranyllinalool or (E)-nerolidol as the substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>GC-MS detected both TMTT and DMNT as the products of CsCYP82L1 or CsCYP82L2 enzymatic activity based on the mass spectra (MS) and the retention time of the authentic standards (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>, <ref type="figure">E</ref>, and <ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>However, neither TMTT nor DMNT was detected within the yeast cells carrying the empty expression vector pYES2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref> and <ref type="figure">G</ref>).</s><s>These results implied that the recombinant CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 could convert (E,E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT or (E)-nerolidol to DMNT.</s></p></div>
