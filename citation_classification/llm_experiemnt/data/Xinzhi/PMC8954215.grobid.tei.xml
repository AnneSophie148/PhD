<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">ACP Traps</head><p><s>We designed insect traps, printed them using a 3D printer, and evaluated them for ACP capture in laboratory and field conditions.</s><s>The two basic designs described in this work are "stem" traps and "cylinder" traps.</s><s>All traps included a main body with a yellowcolored exterior to attract ACPs visually.</s><s>The traps have entry holes either on top of the main body or at different levels on the unit's exterior surface to facilitate the entry of ACPs inside the trap.</s><s>The interior surface of the trap is slippery and connected at the bottom to a capture vial filled with a preservative.</s><s>All traps were fitted with a clear plastic dome, about 100 mm in diameter, to allow sunlight to pass through.</s><s>The light inside the traps attracts ACPs into the dome and then into the trap's body.</s><s>The interior surfaces were made slippery by applying a milky white fluoropolymer resin suspension of polytetrafluoroethylene ("Fluon", marketed as "Insect-a-Slip"; BioQuip, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA).</s><s>It is essential to have sunlight penetrate the trap through the dome since ACP is attracted to light.</s><s>We reapplied "Fluon ® " as needed to maintain the slippery texture on the interior surface of the trap.</s><s>A plastic cover was fitted at the bottom of the cylindrical traps to exclude spiders and other arthropods near the base of the trap.</s><s>After each experiment, or at least once in eight weeks, the traps were washed with detergent and water to clean the body of the trap, and remove dirt and grime from the clear dome.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stem Traps</head><p><s>The stem trap (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) was designed based on our observations that ACP walks along stem-like structures.</s><s>The traps had 2 rows of 16 equidistant circular holes (11 mm) intersected by 4 mm stem-like projections, which extended from the bottom exterior surface of the trap (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>).</s><s>The projections passed through the center of each entry hole and were connected to the interior surface of the trap.</s><s>ACPs land on the exterior surface of traps, walk up these stems leading them into the body of the trap.</s><s>A tripod hanger screwed into the top of the trap body was fitted with a plastic bolt at the center.</s><s>A rain skirt was printed using a 3D printer and hot-glued onto the dome to prevent rainwater from entering the trap's interior through the entry holes.</s><s>A 10 mm hole was drilled on top of the clear plastic dome, and a hanging nut was hot-glued on top.</s><s>The dome was screwed on the top, and a funnel was attached to the bottom of the trap body.</s><s>The preservation vial caps (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., 2019, Cat.</s><s>No. 14-956-7E, Pittsburg, PA, USA) were drilled and hot-glued onto the bottom of the trap funnel.</s><s>Just before the trap deployment, capture vials containing preservation fluid were fitted into the caps.</s><s>All the components were printed using a 3D printer in the stem traps, except the clear plastic dome at the top and the capture tubes attached to the funnel.</s><s>A previous version of the stem traps described here was used for the trapping of the tomato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>; the stem trap described in the current manuscript has many novel features and modifications compared to the one described earlier in the tomato psyllid study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Cylinder Traps</head><p><s>Cylinder traps were assembled using commercially available parts in combination with custom-made funnels printed using a 3D printer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>The external surface of the traps consisted of clear, cylindrical, plastic postal tubes (three-inch diameter, obtained from Uline Inc., Catalog #S-14121, Pleasant Prairie, WI, USA).</s><s>These were cut into eightinch-long pieces and sanded (3M Center, 100 grit: 332U, 320 grit: 738U, St. Paul, MN, USA) to facilitate better paint adhesion.</s><s>Sanded tubes were treated with yellow spray paint (Rust-Oleum, 7747, sunburst yellow, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), fluorescent paint containing barium sulfate (Krylon, 3104, fluorescent lemon-yellow, Cleveland, OH, USA), and a liquid rubberized coating (Clear Flex Seal, Swift Inc., 2019, Weston, FL, USA).</s><s>This created a treated surface on which ACP could easily move (monitored in a laboratory setting).</s><s>The design features of the 3D printed funnel include (1) entry holes, (2) overhang, and (3) funnel.</s><s>Twenty-four equidistant entry holes (4 mm × 4 mm) allowed adult ACPs to enter the trap funnel.</s><s>Due to the size of the orifice, larger insects that could not squeeze through the holes were eliminated from the capture tubes.</s><s>The rim of the trap extruded downward 20 mm, creating a 4 mm thick overhang that provided shade for the entry holes and reduced the amount of light that entered the trap from below.</s><s>The 3D-printed funnel was designed to pressure fit into the painted cylinder, and a clear plastic dome was hot-glued on top.</s><s>A small hole was drilled into the top of the transparent dome, and a small ring of metal wire was hot-glued on the top to facilitate the deployment of the trap on a citrus tree.</s></p></div>
