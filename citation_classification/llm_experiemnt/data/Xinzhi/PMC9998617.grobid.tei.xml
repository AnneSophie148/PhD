<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The vertical transmission of a symbiotic virus of R. dorsalis</s></p><p><s>We identified a previously undescribed Recilia dorsalis filamentous virus (RdFV) belonging to the Virgaviridae family from field-caught R. dorsalis population in Guangdong Province, Southern China in 2018, based on analysis of RNA sequencing data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>The (+) singlestranded RNA genome of RdFV was 16,158 nt in length (GenBank accession No. OP326514) and contained 6 open reading frames (ORFs) to encode 6 proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid protein (CP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences of RdRp showed that RdFV clustered with plant-infecting furoviruses in Virgaviridae family, which contained plant virgavirus lineages and unclassified insect-infecting virga-like virus group, such as Hubei virga-like viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>RdFV possessed a high incidence of about 80% in lab-reared male or female R. dorsalis population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy assays showed that RdFV CP was distributed in the midgut or salivary glands of virus-positive R. dorsalis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that RdFV CP antibody specifically reacted with the filamentous viral particles in the cytoplasm of the midgut epithelium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, <ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To explore whether RdFV can be vertically transmitted, the offspring of four mating pairings, including infected unfemales × uninfected males; infected females × uninfected males; uninfected females × infected males; and infected female × infected males, were collected and analyzed.</s><s>We observed about 52%, 67%, and 85% positive for RdFV from the offspring of infected females mating with uninfected males, uninfected females mating with infected males, and infected females mating with infected males, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, paternal transmission of RdFV was more efficient than maternal transmission.</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RdFV CP distributed in male testes and female ovaries (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, RdFV CP was closely associated with most of the sperms directly dissected from infected male testes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, <ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that RdFV CP antibody specifically reacted with the filamentous viral particles in the germ cells of female ovary (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), or associated with the sperms in male testes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>, <ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Such association of RdFV particles with sperms did not affect sperm morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy showed that virusassociated sperms were present in the dissected spermatheca of uninfected females at 5-day post mating with infected males (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>), confirming the transfer of virus-associated sperms from infected males to females.</s><s>Mating experiments shown above (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>) suggested that such RdFV-associated sperms in the spermatheca finally fertilized the mature eggs during ovulation.</s><s>We thus determine that RdFV can be vertically transmitted in R. dorsalis via transovarial or sperm-mediated paternal transmission.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the effect of RdFV infection on the fitness of R. dorsalis population, the eggs produced by two mating pairings, including one RdFV-positive virgin female × one RdFV-positive male and one RdFV-free virgin female × one RdFV-free male, were collected and analyzed.</s><s>It was found that RdFV prolonged adult longevity and promoted egg development (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6</ref>).</s><s>For example, the mean longevity of the RdFV-positive male population (22 d) was about 4 d longer than that of the RdFV-free male population (18 d) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, RdFV-positive parents laid about 20% more eggs compared to RdFV-free parents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6b</ref>).</s><s>More importantly, the RdFV-positive eggs developed better than RdFV-free controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6c</ref>).</s><s>The mean development duration for virus-positive eggs was reduced by about 2 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6d</ref>), and the hatching rate for RdFV-positive eggs was increased by about 10% at 11 days after oviposition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6e</ref>).</s><s>Thus, RdFV infection benefits the fitness of host adults and their offspring, and thus does not affect the functions of host sperm or ovary.</s></p><p><s>RdFV or RGDV activates HongrES1 in male reproductive system of R. dorsalis</s></p><p><s>We then used RdFV CP as a
