<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this paper, transmission electron microscopy and immuno-gold labeling were used to characterize viral inclusions and subcellular localization in RSV-infected SBPH, which facilitates to further understand transmission mechanisms of RSV.</s><s>In the experiment, we observed no the particles of RSV RNPs in viral inclusions or insect cells via direct electron microscopy, which is considered reasonable.</s><s>The RNPs of RSV have a thin filamentous shape (3-10 nm in diameter), with lengths proportional to the sizes of the RNAs they contain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The filamentous particles may appear to be spiral-shaped, branched or circular <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, in the ultrathin sections of RSV-infected tissues, the particles of RSV RNPs are very difficult (almost impossible) to distinguish from host subcellular components.</s><s>Viral inclusions, known as viral factories, are confirmed as the replication and assembly sites of virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which are also named viroplasms in the reoviruses.</s><s>We found RSV inclusion bodies in SBPH cells were extremely similar with viral inclusions in rice plants.</s><s>A large number of RSV amorphous inclusions aggregated in the cytoplasm of follicular cells of ovarioles, which indicates that the replication and assembly of RSV are more intensive in the follicular cells than in other tissues of viruliferous SBPH.</s><s>In the ovarioles of SBPH, the monolayer follicular cells surround the developing oocytes and transport nutrition into oocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Stronger accumulation of the virus in the follicular cells suggests that RSV might spread into the ovum along with the nutrition when the follicular cells transport nutrition to develop ovum, and the initial virus in the oocytes might derive from the follicular cells.</s><s>Wu et al. (2012) also showed that there were numerous RSV RNPs aggregation in the follicular cells, germarium, and nutritive cords of the ovary with the immunofluorescence microscopy, and they considered that RSV entered in the oocytes together with the nutrition via the follicular cells and nutritive cords <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which is basically consistent with our results.</s><s>The latest research revealed the nutrition accompanied the virus in the process of transovarial transmission was the vitellogenin (unpublished).</s><s>Moreover, uniform distribution of RSV RNP particles on the eggshell surface was observed, which suggestes the entering ovum sites of RSV might be disseminated and no regional specificity on the surface of ovum.</s><s>As is known, there is the ovary barrier for the transovarial transmission of RSV in SBPH.</s><s>According to the above mentioned, a potential mechanism of RSV transovarial transmission was proposed that the virus initially replicated and accumulated in the inclusion bodies of follicular cells, then exploited the pathway of the nutrition (vitellogenin) transportation to pass through the eggshell and spread into the oocytes along with the vitellogenin.</s><s>Afterwards, RSV could continue to accumulate in SBPH eggs during the embryonic development.</s></p><p><s>About the viral components of RSV inclusions, it is still no systematic research.</s><s>In general, constituents of viral inclusions contain viral multiple structural and nonstructural proteins, as well as host cell components.</s><s>For instance, the viroplasm of Rice dwarf virus (RDV) contains the non-structural proteins Pns6, Pns11, Pns12 and core proteins P1, P3, P5, P7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>virus (SRBSDV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>RSV is a single stranded RNA virus with four segmented genomes which contain 7 ORFs, and uses a negative and ambisense coding strategy for replication and infection in hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Seven ORFs encode RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), NS2 (a silencing suppressor with other unknown functions), NSvc2, NS3 (a suppressor of gene silencing), nucleocapsid protein (NCP), SP and movement protein NSvc4, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>RSV RNP particles are composed of the genomic RNAs, NCP and RdRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, so RSV inclusions, as the replication and assembly sites of virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, contain definitely structural protein NCP and replicase RdRP.</s><s>As previously reported, most electron-dense amorphous semi-electronopaque inclusion bodies (dASO) of RSV contained only SP, while some dASO contained at least NS2, NSvc2 Nterminal, NS3, NCP as well as SP.</s><s>The ring-like inclusions contained at least NSvc2 N-terminal, SP and NSvc4.</s><s>Fibrillar amorphous semi-electron-opaque inclusion bodies (fASO) contained only SP, and the filamentous electronopaque inclusion bodies (FEO) consisted of SP and NSvc2 N-terminal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>It is remarkable that dASO, fASO and ring-like inclusions were only found in RSV-infected rice tissues, whereas FEO was identified both in infected rice cells and in the midgut epithelial cells of SBPH.</s><s>The amorphous RSV inclusions observed in this study are very similar to dASO described by Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, but different from FEO, which suggests that dASO might also exist in SBPH cells.</s><s>According to the subcellular localization results, there was the largest RSV accumulation in the ovary, followed by the midgut lumen and epithelial cells, and the least in the muscles.</s><s>The midgut is a barrier where virus invades into insect vector through a transcytosis mechanism, and the ovary is also a barrier for the transovarial transmission of RSV.</s><s>Therefore, numerous RSV RNPs aggregation in the two barriers is in line with the expectations.</s><s>Since the sperm is not the carrier of RSV, the virus in insect offspring only derives from maternal parents when insects feed on uninfected plants.</s><s>Massive accumulation of RSV in the ovary may be an adaptation for the interaction between RSV and SBPH, which facilitates its transovarial (vertical) transmission and propagation.</s><s>A few viruses, such as RDV and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), could infect the vector visceral muscles to bypass conveniently the basal lamina barrier of the midgut <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>Fewer presence of RSV in the muscles suggests that RSV might exploit vector's muscles for its spread in SBPH body with a lower efficiency.</s></p><p><s>Numerous endogenous microorganisms were observed in SBPH body.</s><s>The yeast-like endosymbiotes (YLES) were found in the fat bodies of ovum.</s><s>Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the YLES consists of fungal species from the ascomycetes and pyrenomycetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>These YLES are transovarially inherited, and benefit their hosts by providing nutrition such as vitamins and sterols.</s><s>The loss of YLES under high temperature can cause deleterious effect on the host insect <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The species of YLES have been identified through close examination of the combined EST library of SBPH, and 3061 unigenes that matched well with the 45 genera fungal species were retrieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Besides fungi, a variety of endosymbiotic bacteria were found in the digestive tract of SBPH, but bacteria species was not identified.</s><s>At present, there is still no detailed research about the species of endosymbiotic bacteria in SBPH.</s><s>In SBPH, Wolbachia infection is familiar and it was reported that the bacterium is distributed in the head, thorax, abdomen, salivary gland, guts, ovary and testis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al. (2010)</ref> showed the number of transcripts of Wolbachia in non-viruliferous SBPH was four-fold larger than that of viruliferous insect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>It is not clear whether this expression bias is associated with RSV infection.</s><s>A 63 kDa chaperon GroEL protein, produced by bacterial endosymbionts, potentially plays a crucial role in virus transmission in aphid and whitefly by binding to virus particles and protecting them from rapid proteolytic degradation in gut and haemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>So far, the interaction between GroEL and Tenuivirus has not been found.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Li et al. (2011)</ref> used a virus overlay assay of protein blots to investigate the RSV-vector interactions, and did not find the binding between GroEL and RSV RNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Buchnera GroEL is an important chaperon to protect virus particles in aphid and whitefly B. tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, so we searched Buchnera groEL sequence against the EST library of SBPH constructed by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but no significant matches were retrieved.</s><s>Moreover, no groEL genes from SBPH endosymbiotic bacteria have been cloned, except for Wolbachia groEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Whether the GroEL with a capability to protect RSV exists in SBPH remain to be further elucidated.</s></p><p><s>It is remarkable that a large numbers of crystal-like spherical virions were observed in SBPH midgut.</s><s>According to their shape and diameter, we hypothesized that the parasitic virus might be Himetobi P virus (HiPV), an insect picorna-like virus.</s><s>HiPV was originally isolated from SBPH when researchers attempted to purify RSV from its vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which suggested a high concentration of HiPV in viruliferous (RSV) SBPH populations.</s><s>A previous study reported there were high incidences of HiPV infection in several laboratory cultures of SBPH, while the virus was detected at a low incidence in SBPH populations in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The insect samples used in this study were also from the cultures maintained in author's laboratory for several years.</s><s>HiPV infects obligately the midgut of host insects with an asymptomatic infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, while the midgut is precisely a vital barrier that RSV invades into SBPH.</s><s>Furthermore, an interaction between RSV-NCP and one (VP1) of HiPV three major capsid proteins was also detected using a yeast two-hybrid screen by author's laboratory (unpublished).</s><s>As mentioned above, it was proposed that endosymbiotic HiPV in SBPH might affect potentially the replication and transmission of RSV through some unknown mechanisms.</s><s>The hypothesis is worthy of further study.</s></p></div>
