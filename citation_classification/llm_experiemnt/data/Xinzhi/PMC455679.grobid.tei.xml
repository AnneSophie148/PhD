<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In mid to late-June, C. trifurcata was observed on pumpkin plants at the first true-leaf growth stage with associated damage to the plants in the field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Adults rarely migrate from one field to another within a growing season <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Waldbauer and Kogan 1976)</ref>, and over winter under stubble in the field or in wooded areas adjacent to soybean fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lam and Pedigo 2000)</ref>.</s><s>The pumpkin field that we sampled was likely at high risk to being infested by C. trifurcata, because it was planted to soybeans the year before, contained soybean stubble and volunteer soybeans, and was surrounded by wooded habitat on three sides.</s><s>The observed decline in the abundance of C. trifurcata (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) temporally matched the decline of over wintered adults observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Loughran and Ragsdale (1986)</ref>, suggesting that the decline was due to natural population dynamics rather than repellency from the pumpkin field.</s></p><p><s>Our laboratory studies confirmed that C. trifurcata will feed on cucurbits.</s><s>Damage to cucurbits caused by C. trifurcata appeared similar to damage caused by A. vittatum, with feeding occurring between the veins of the leaves, consuming either a layer of tissue from the top or bottom the leaf; eventually feeding may result in a hole through the leaf <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Burkness 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Cucumber plants appeared to be more susceptible to C. trifurcata than either pumpkin or squash (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>Differential susceptibility of the various cucurbits to feeding may have been due to differences in cucurbitacin concentration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Tallamy et al. 1991)</ref> or differences in size and thickness of the leaf tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>C. trifurcata fed on cucumber plants, albeit a small amount, when soybean plants were present, which corroborates our observation of their presence on pumpkin plants in the field when volunteer soybean plants were present.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. trifurcata feeding on cucumber, squash, or pumpkin.</s><s>However, their pest potential for cucurbits remains uncertain and needs further investigation.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burkness and Hutchison (1998)</ref> found that for cotyledon to first true leaf stage cucumbers, only 10-15 % defoliation was necessary to cause a significant yield loss.</s><s>In our no-choice feeding study, densities of 10 C. trifurcata per cucumber plant resulted in about 19 % of the leaf area having distinct holes.</s><s>With maximum densities of 0.36 C. trifurcata per plant observed in the field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), it seems unlikely that feeding will result in economic losses.</s><s>However, densities of ten C. trifurcata per plant did result in severe damage to some of the cucumber plants, which would likely lead to plant death (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>C. trifurcata may be even less of a threat to pumpkin and squash plants, due to the ability of pumpkin and squash plants to tolerate higher levels of defoliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hoffmann et al. 2000)</ref>, and the relatively low levels of feeding on pumpkin and squash plants (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, additional feeding studies, including the relationship between cucurbitacin concentration and feeding damage should be examined.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Abundance of Cerotoma trifurcata on pumpkin ('Magic Lantern') plants near Rosemount, MN, 2003.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,312.00,282.65,280.80,197.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
