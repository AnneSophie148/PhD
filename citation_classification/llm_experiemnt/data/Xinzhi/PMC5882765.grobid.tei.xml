<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama: Hemiptera, Laviidae) transmits (acquires, retains, and inoculates) a phloem-limited, unculturable, alpha proteobacterium (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus <ref type="bibr">[CLas]</ref>) that is the putative causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB).</s><s>Both the pathogen and its vector are highly invasive species presenting global challenges to the citrus industry.</s><s>In the U.S., the first record of the psyllid in Florida was in 1998, and the disease was first detected in Florida in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Halbert 2005</ref>).</s><s>The disease reduces fruit quality and causes tree mortality, thereby resulting in extensive economic losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hodges et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The psyllid was reported from Texas for the first time in 2001 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(French et al. 2001)</ref>, and reported for the first time from <ref type="bibr">California in 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Grafton-Cardwell 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The disease was first detected in both Texas and California in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kumagai et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kunta et al. 2014b)</ref>.</s><s>In 2016, D. citri was found for the first time in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shimwela et al. 2016)</ref>, and both vector and pathogen are expected to spread to all citrus producing regions worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Narouei-Khandan et al. 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A number of HLB disease management strategies are being developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grafton-Cardwell et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hall et al. 2013)</ref>, with the ones most relevant herein being those strategies focused on vector control using insecticides or host plant resistance against the psyllid.</s><s>Success of these strategies is not dependent on insect mortality alone, because it may be possible for the target psyllid to transmit the pathogen prior to dying, thus making the insecticide application and/or some types of host plant resistance ineffective for disease management.</s></p><p><s>For acquisition, it is important to understand how the insecticide influences the insect's ability to achieve phloem sap ingestion following salivation on infected plants.</s><s>Naturally, acquisition would only be important in cases where the insect lives long enough to disperse to another tree or part of the same tree and then inoculate a healthy host or to move the pathogen within an infected host in cases where the pathogen is not already ubiquitous within that host (respectively).</s><s>This latter condition is important in the CLas-citrus system, as the pathogen is not uniformly distributed <ref type="bibr">(Kunta et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Louzada et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Acquisition of CLas is more efficient in older nymphs than any other stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Xu et al. 1988</ref>).</s><s>However, distribution of nymphs is dependent on oviposition site selection by adult females.</s><s>D. citri adults can be found on all aerial parts of the tree in a citrus grove.</s><s>However, eggs are only laid close to apical meristems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Huang et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yang et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>First and second instar nymphs can only survive at this location, although older nymphs can survive on older leaves (Arredondo de <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ibarra 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>CLas is a persistent, circulative pathogen, and therefore is inoculated (after a latent period) during salivation from the vector's infected salivary glands.</s><s>To understand inoculation, phloem salivation in healthy plants is most important.</s><s>Inoculation has been experimentally successful with inoculation access periods (IAP) ranging from 15 min to 7 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grafton-Cardwell et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Inoue et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pelz-Stelinski et al. 2010</ref>).</s><s>This range is important because there is variability in the time it takes an individual psyllid to reach phloem.</s><s>Thus, with individual psyllids there is some probability that it will take 15 min or less, though it is likely to take much longer.</s><s>The IAP will decline as the number of psyllids increases because it is more likely that at least one individual will reach phloem within a short time.</s></p><p><s>We are especially interested in understanding how insecticides influence the ability of D. citri to reach the phloem, thus expanding on earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Serikawa 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Serikawa et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Serikawa et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>One question we had was whether psyllid behavior was the same no matter where or when it occurred on the plant.</s><s>This is an important point if the purpose of an insecticide application is to prevent CLas transmission, because one needs to conduct tests on the plant organ where the psyllid is most likely to reach the phloem.</s><s>If organ age or surface does not matter for transmission of CLas, then one could conduct tests wherever it was convenient.</s><s>Our experimental design also addressed several additional questions: 1) Assuming that there is an effect of adaxial versus abaxial locations and an effect of immature versus mature leaves, which effect is greater?</s><s>Answering this question will improve experimental methodologies by identifying the approach where the psyllid's stylets reach phloem as quickly as possible and remain in the phloem for the greatest length of time.</s><s>This optimal location provides the overall best chance to acquire or inoculate the phloem limited pathogen.</s><s>2) Is xylem sap ingestion a natural part of psyllid behavior, or an artifact of stress caused by wiring for EPG and possibly stress from the short starvation period necessary to wire the psyllids?</s><s>This issue is important because immature tissues are more abundant at some times of year, and it is useful to know whether the probability of phloem contact is the same regardless of when or where the psyllid is probing.</s><s>3) How fast must an insecticide work to prevent acquisition and/or inoculation of CLas?</s><s>Understanding this timing is critical in designing bioassays that test insecticide efficacy for vector management as a tool for pathogen management.</s></p><p><s>While D. citri adults can be found on all above-ground parts of the tree, the psyllid generally prefers to settle on the abaxial leaf surface close to the midvein (Arredondo de Ibarra 2009).</s><s>However, presence does not necessarily equate to probing and ingesting.</s><s>It is not known whether the psyllid can ingest phloem or xylem from all of these organs.</s><s>To better understand the probing behavior of D. citri we examined the probing behavior of this insect on immature and mature leaves on both adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Plants We used citrus resets that were cv.</s><s>'Midsweet' orange scion on cv.</s><s>'Kuharsky' rootstock (Southern Citrus Nurseries Inc., Dundee, FL: certified CLas free), both for rearing psyllids and as test plants.</s><s>Plants were pruned and fertilized (variously with Chelated Citrus Nutritional Spray from Southern Agricultural Insecticides Inc. Palmetto, FL, USA, Miracle-Gro All-Purpose Plant Food, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Marysville, OH, USA, or Harrell's Profertilizer 12-3-8, Harrell's LLC, Lakeland, FL) consistent with label instructions to promote flush.</s><s>All plants had flush, even those used to test mature leaves.</s></p><p><s>Mature leaves were dark green, fully expanded, and at least one-month old.</s><s>Immature leaves were light green, not fully expanded, of variable age (four to ten days old).</s><s>The main criterion for defining leaf status was leaf stickiness.</s><s>If one rubbed a finger over a mature leaf, the waxy coating made the leaf feel slick.</s><s>One could apply pressure, and the finger would slide across the surface without causing damage.</s><s>Such leaves are found close to the apical meristem of new flush (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Immature leaves have a lighter green color but even fully expanded leaves are still light green (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>A finger rubbed across the surface will tend to stick (slightly), and with pressure, the leaf will roll and tear.</s><s>After initial training, immature leaves are easily identified by a light touch, or subtle changes in color.</s><s>Only undamaged leaves were used in experiments.</s><s>Under our growing conditions, immature leaves measured 1.0 to 2.5 cm wide and 2 to 4 cm long.</s><s>Mature leaves measured 4.3 to 6.2 cm wide by 6.4 to 10 cm long.</s><s>Immature leaves are less than half the size of a mature leaf on these plants.</s></p><p><s>Insects Psyllids were from a laboratory colony that was started in 2006 from fieldcollected material.</s><s>This was considered a CLas-free colony because CLas was first reported in Polk county, Florida, August 24, 2007 (<ref type="url" target="http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/extension/greening/history.shtml">http://www.crec.ifas.ufl</ref>.</s></p><p><s>9 6.5 cm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 8 Adaxial abaxial</s></p><p><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The sequence of leaves showing color differences between a mature leaf (#1), a fully expanded leaf (#2), immature leaves (#3-#16), and the youngest leaves at the apical meristem (#17).</s><s>In this sequence, leaves #5-#12 would be suitable for testing.</s><s>Note that the mature leaf was from the same plant as the other leaves, but was not part of the flush edu/extension/greening/history.shtml).</s><s>Plants for psyllid rearing were selected from the plants reared under conditions described above.</s><s>The psyllid colony was contained in fabric cages (Bioquip 1466BV: Bioquip.com,</s><s>Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) in the same greenhouse used to grow plants.</s><s>We did not determine sex or age of the adult psyllids prior to recording.</s></p><p><s>Experiment Adult psyllids were selected arbitrarily from the colony for testing.</s><s>Plants with flush were arbitrarily selected from the greenhouse from all the plants with flush.</s></p><p><s>The greenhouse had 200 plants, but not all plants flush at the same time.</s><s>A total of 100 insects were recorded, 37 for the immature abaxial treatment, 19 each for the immature adaxial and mature adaxial treatments, and 25 for the mature abaxial treatment.</s><s>Insects that jumped or walked off the plant were eliminated from the analysis, explaining the unequal sample sizes.</s></p><p><s>Electropenetrography These methods have been reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ebert and Rogers 2016)</ref>.</s><s>A 25.4 μm diameter gold wire (Sigma Cohn Corp., Vernon, NY) was attached to an adult psyllid pronotum using silver glue.</s><s>A ~30 min starvation period was sufficient time to collect, wire, and set up the experiment.</s><s>This starvation period is somewhat longer than the average flight duration period where blue-green females would fly an average of 14 min, while brown males would average 0.8 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Martini et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We used two four-channel AC-DC monitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Backus and Bennett 2009)</ref> that were custom-built by EPG Technologies, Inc. (Gainesville, FL), set to input impedance of 10 9 and 150 mV DC substrate voltage.</s><s>Gains used were 160× adjusted amplification (on the control box) and 100× fixed amplification in the head-stage amplifier.</s><s>Light was provided by overhead fluorescent lights (24:0 L:D) at 26.6 °C.</s></p><p><s>The equipment was set to record for 24 h because a shorter recording time would not be adequate

waveforms (NP [nonprobing], C [pathway], D [phloem contact], E1 [phloem salivation], E2 [phloem ingestion], and G [xylem ingestion]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bonani et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Five other waveforms have been described that provide additional biological detail in the non-probing and pathway waveforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cen et al. 2012;</ref><ref

in understanding host plant resistance issues.</s><s>However, we did not use these waveforms because it was not necessary for this experiment.</s><s>At the end of each recording, a behavioral event occurs that ends prematurely because we stopped the recording.</s><s>This event was deleted.</s></p><p><s>EPG Data Analysis: Programs and Variables All of our analyses used the Ebert 2.0 analysis program, <ref type="url" target="http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/extension/epg/sas.shtml">http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/extension/epg/sas.shtml</ref> that runs within the SAS® software environment.</s><s>We used SAS software release 9.4 M4 running under SAS Enterprise Guide 7.13.</s><s>There were a total of 85 variables available for the following analyses (see supplement for full list).</s></p><p><s>The initial analysis used Proc GLIMMIX, which uses Reduced Maximum Likelihood methods for mixed model ANOVA, resulting in improved power of statistical tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gbur et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Within this procedure, means were separated using the LSD test, with α = 0.05.</s><s>Data were transformed prior to analysis (typically, log transformation for durations, square root transformation for frequencies).</s><s>We transformed percentages as log(p/(1-p)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Warton and Hui 2011)</ref>, but a few cases had Q-Q plots closer to normally distributed when we used the arcsine square root transformation.</s><s>See Table <ref type="table">S</ref>-1 in Supplemental Information for a list of all the variables and the transformations.</s></p><p><s>Data Analysis: Transitional Probabilities Ebert 2.0 also was used to calculate the number of transitional events for each waveform.</s><s>The arrows in our behavioral kinetogram (see Results) were produced by dividing these values by the total number of transitional events in each treatment.</s><s>The circles in our behavioral kinetogram have an area proportional to the total recording time for each treatment.</s><s>For both the arrows and the circles, there is only a single, summed value for each treatment.</s><s>Therefore, statistical analyses are not possible.</s></p><p><s>Data Analysis: Univariate ANOVA Analyses EPG recordings are a temporal sequence of specific behavioral events.</s><s>We can measure how soon they occur, or how many of them occur after some specific event.</s><s>We can calculate counts, means, means of means, standard deviations, and a variety of other summary statistics.</s><s>Our overall goal is to describe how the insect behaves.</s><s>In this task, it is important to know which behaviors showed significant differences and which ones did not.</s><s>We suspect that certain behaviors are constrained at the species, genus, or family level.</s><s>Thus, a lack of significance is not sufficient to decide that a specific variable is unimportant.</s><s>Despite this acknowledgment, it is typical to only report variables that are significant.</s><s>Therefore, we have placed the results for all variables in the supplemental material.</s><s>Data Analysis: Multiple Regression Analysis We performed a regression analysis to explicitly test the effect of age, side, and their interaction.</s><s>The regression model used in our study required the creation of two binary dummy variables.</s><s>One dummy variable codes for leaf age, the other for the side of the leaf.</s></p><p><s>Data Analysis: Multivariate Analyses We performed a stepwise discriminant analysis (SAS, Proc StepDisc) to reduce the 85 variables by identifying ones that had the greatest explanatory power and were least correlated with other variables in the model.</s><s>Using the reduced number of variables, we ran a canonical discriminant analysis (SAS, Proc CanDisc) to visualize the results by plotting the first two canonical correlates.</s><s>A discriminant analysis (SAS, Proc Discrim) was run to calculate Mahalanobis distances and the classification error rate.</s><s>We used the nonparametric method with a kernel of 1, 2, or 10.</s><s>We only report results for kernel of size 1 because that model had the lowest classification error rate.</s></p><p><s>Histological comparison of sweet orange cultivars: In the time it has taken to complete the EPG portion of this experiment, several manuscripts were published that conducted parallel experimental design to ours.</s><s>In an effort to place our experiment into context with these other studies, we chose to include a histological comparison of the immature and mature leaves of the sweet orange cultivar used in our study (Midsweet) compared to the cultivar (Valencia) used in another similar study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(George et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>We knew from previous histological studies performed in our lab, that these two cultivars have nearly identical leaf anatomy, are both highly preferred by D. citri, and are thus both excellent cultivar choices for EPG studies on baseline behavioral preferences.</s><s>One important difference between ours and the George et al.

Overall, E1 contributes less to E (CntrbE1toE) on either surface of immature leaves than on either surface of mature leaves.</s><s>Furthermore, while E1 contributed more to E on the adaxial surface of mature leaves than on the abaxial surface, this relationship was not significant on immature leaves.</s><s>In addition, the number of E1 events (NumE1) was significantly greater on the abaxial surface of immature leaves relative to all other treatments (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, there are more attempts to achieve phloem ingestion on immature leaves, but the relative contributions of D and E1 to phloem activities decline as a part of the D-E1-E2 pattern.</s></p><p><s>Psyllids spent more time in phloem ingestion per insect (i.e., total duration of E2, TtlDurE2, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) on immature leaves versus older leaves, with no difference between surfaces on each leaf type.</s><s>This finding for per-insect E2 durations was caused by a combination of per-event E2 durations and numbers of E2 events.</s><s>When all E2 event durations were averaged (mean duration of E2, MnDurE2), the psyllid ingested for longer per event on immature leaves than on mature leaves, with no difference between abaxial and adaxial surface of immature leaves but a significant difference on mature leaves.</s><s>The number of E2 events (NumE2) was greatest on the abaxial surface of immature leaves.</s><s>There were significantly fewer on the adaxial surface of immature leaves, and fewer still on adaxial surface of mature leaves.</s></p><p><s>Most of the other variables associated with phloem activities (D, E1, or E2) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (i.e., duration of the longest E2 event in a recording, DurMxE2;

depending upon their position on the host plant.</s><s>Studies have shown that choosing to ingest xylem is a natural behavior in aphids that is associated with general osmotic regulation, and therefore not just a stress response <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pompon et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spiller et al. 1990)</ref>.</s><s>Osmotic regulation may be important in psyllids, as in aphids, either because the psyllid needs water for osmoregulation or because it does not need additional nutrition for reproduction or dispersal.</s><s>This conclusion is based on an observation that xylem in citrus was little more than a 5× dilution of phloem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hijaz and Killiny 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Killiny and Hijaz 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, reproduction is only possible on new flush, and new flush is not present during winter months.</s><s>During this time, psyllids are found on mature leaves but would only need enough nutrition and water to survive until flush was once again available.</s><s>Xylem ingestion may satisfy these requirements more easily than phloem.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the importance of chemistry for tissue selection, recent histological evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ammar et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ammar et al. , 2014) )</ref> has shown that constitutive anatomical defenses like thicker fibrous rings (sclerenchyma, also called phloem fiber, or bast fiber cells) around phloem can influence psyllid behavior.</s><s>The differences in abaxial versus adaxial ingestion behavior may be partly attributable to morphological differences in the distribution of fibrous ring <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ammar et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, the presence and thickness of the fibrous ring is determined in part by leaf age.</s><s>In Midsweet and Valencia cultivars of sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, the fibrous ring is absent in immature leaves (like those used in our study).</s><s>However, the ringis present(but only one or two cell layers thick) in medium aged leaves (like those used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">George et al. 2017)</ref>, and deepens to 3 to 6 cell layers thick in mature leaves.</s><s>These thickened cell walls of the fibrous ring present an anatomical barrier to psyllid probing that must be crossed or circumvented by the stylets to reach phloem or xylem.</s><s>However, this would not explain why a psyllid that reached phloem would pull out of phloem and choose xylem ingestion some of the time.</s><s>One would expect that physical barriers might result in differences in variables like time to first phloem ingestion (E2), while having little or no effect in variables dealing with the proportion of time spent ingesting phloem versus xylem; however, this was not the case.</s><s>We are left to conclude that anatomical defenses do not explain preference for xylem ingestion.</s></p><p><s>Recent literature documents many factors that could account for the observed behavioral differences in the psyllid based on leaf age and abaxial/adaxial position.</s><s>In mature leaves, the midrib has a core of dead, lignified pith cells.</s><s>Moving out from the pith, around this core are xylem cells, and then a layer of phloem, the cambial layer, the fibrous ring of sclerenchyma, parenchyma cells, and then the epidermis.</s><s>The fibrous ring can have channels, and may have lateral gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ammar et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The thickness of the fibrous ring was implicated as a mechanical barrier in psyllid resistant plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ammar et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">George et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>While this structure does affect insect behavior, it does not explain our results because the psyllids must go through the phloem cells to get to xylem.</s><s>Thus, the psyllid is already past the cuticle, parenchyma, and fibrous ring when it contacts the part of the phloem where ingestion may take place, and it must move past the phloem to reach the xylem.</s><s>It is therefore unlikely that morphological differences will determine whether psyllid adults will select phloem or xylem.</s></p><p><s>Many other factors could account for the observed behavioral plasticity of psyllids, based on leaf age and abaxial/adaxial position.</s><s>Although it is not in the scope of this paper to thoroughly review recent research, such factors could include: 1) presence or structure of wax on mature versus immature leaves, 2) the role of chemical defenses such as compounds in non-vascular cells along the pathway, or translocated in phloem or xylem, 3) visual cues such as color to distinguish mature versus immature leaves, 4) various nutritional profiles of mature versus immature leaves, especially related to phloem versus xylem and the sink-source transition from immature to mature leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Turgeon 1989)</ref>.</s><s>Of these factors, nutrition may be especially important.</s><s>The general conclusion of several recent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hijaz et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Killiny 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Setamou et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Valim and Killiny 2017</ref>) is that the nutritional composition of phloem changes depending on the species, cultivar, and the age of the plant tissues.</s><s>Based on this literature, we can conclude that there were nutritional differences between immature and mature leaves in our experiment, and similar experiments by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(George et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Luo et al. 2015)</ref>, as well as nutritional differences due to host species and cultivar used in each study.</s></p><p><s>Insects engage in compensatory feeding to overcome nutritional deficiencies in their diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Couture et al. 2016</ref>).</s><s>Based on the compensatory feeding hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Couture et al. 2016)</ref>, one might expect that phloem ingestion on mature leaves would increase to compensate for reduced amino acid levels on mature leaves.</s><s>However, this was not the case in our experiment.</s><s>There are at least three possible reasons why this could happen.</s><s>First, the mature leaves might have chemical defenses.</s><s>Second, these difference may be a strategic change in the psyllid wherein phloem ingestion is elevated on flush, in preparation for reproduction, while greatly reduced on mature leaves where the psyllid only needs to survive until flush is present.</s><s>Third, the reduced nutritive content of phloem fluids in mature leaves could be a form of host plant resistance, as was demonstrated in a resistant sugarcane cultivar <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akbar et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hijaz et al. 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Comparison with Literature Currently, there are two published articles that looked at the effect of leaf age on psyllid behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(George et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Luo et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Both of these articles show some effect of leaf age on feeding behavior.</s><s>However, the details of what behavioral changes take place are a bit different between these studies.</s><s>We suggest that the results between these manuscripts and ours are not comparable because Byoung^or Bimmature^leaf is not a constant across studies and we have shown that leaves that are fully expanded but immature are morphologically distinct from leaves that are not fully expanded in that the immature leaves lack a fibrous ring.</s><s>It is likely that our Bimmature leaf^is close to Luo's Bnew shoot^category.</s><s>The presence of any cell layers of fibrous ring will act as an impediment to D. citri probing behaviors performed in vascular tissues.</s><s>The insects must either pass through or locate a gap in the phloem fiber cells in order to locate vascular tissues.</s><s>The necessity of such searching delays the time to first access of vascular tissues and thusly the presence of an incompletely developed fibrous ring in immature but fully expanded leaves and a well-developed fibrous ring in mature leaves can be described as a resistance feature to D. citri probing.</s></p><p><s>Also, EPG researchers should take note from this study of the importance of a long recording time for psyllids.</s><s>An 8 h recording time (standard for aphid recordings) is not appropriate for these insects.</s><s>Especially in treatments where it took psyllids much longer than 8 h to reach phloem, incorrect conclusions would be reached with a short recording time.</s><s>For example, had we used an 8 h recording time, we would have concluded that the psyllid was incapable of feeding on the adaxial surface of leaves.</s></p><p><s>Implications for Insecticide Studies How much time does it take an insecticide to kill a psyllid?</s><s>Is it enough time to prevent either acquisition or inoculation of CLas by D. citri?</s><s>Both parts of transmission occur when stylets reach the phloem.</s><s>Therefore, the answer depends upon leaf surface and age used for the test.</s><s>Our results showed that psyllids reach the phloem more quickly (in about 7.5 versus 12.5 h, on average) and reliably (75% of insects versus 38% on average) when they feed while standing on the abaxial surface of immature leaves.</s><s>This range is consistent with previously published results <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grafton-Cardwell et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Inoue et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pelz-Stelinski et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, insecticide experiments should use the abaxial surface of immature leaves for assessing insecticide efficacy.</s><s>The minimum duration before phloem ingestion on abaxial immature leaves was only 8.4 min, despite the average being many hours.</s><s>Thus a few insects reach phloem quickly, and the important issue involves deciding what level of insecticide protection is sufficient and if it is possible, legal, or economical to apply sufficient insecticide to achieve that goal.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions We have documented that D. citri not infected with CLas choose (most of the time) to ingest phloem on immature citrus leaves, while those on mature choose xylem.</s><s>During winter, when flush is scarce, this may result in a reduced rate at which an uninfected adult psyllid can acquire CLas.</s><s>The rate at which an infected adult inoculates may also be reduced in times of minimal flush.</s></p><p><s>We asked four questions in the introduction to this manuscript that we can rephrase as statements given the results from our study.</s><s>1) The strength of the effect of leaf age is greater than the effect of feeding location (abaxial/adaxial).</s><s>However, there is a statistically significant difference between feeding on the abaxial versus adaxial leaf surface.</s><s>2) D. citri is predominantly a phloem feeder on immature leaves, and predominantly a xylem feeder on mature leaves of favorable hosts.</s><s>3) An insecticide must act within a few minutes to guarantee protection because our minimum observed time to first E2 (phloem ingestion) was 8.4 min.</s></p><p><s>The primary method for managing Huanglongbing is by controlling the vector using insecticides.</s><s>Insecticide research focused on showing that an insecticide prevents the psyllids from contacting the phloem should focus experiments on psyllids that are given access to immature leaves where there is a better chance that the psyllid will attempt and succeed in ingesting from
