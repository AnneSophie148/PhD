<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Allium sativum leaf agglutinin (ASAL) is a 25-kDa homodimeric, insecticidal, mannose binding lectin whose subunits are assembled by the C-terminal exchange process.</s><s>An attempt was made to convert dimeric ASAL into a monomeric form to correlate the relevance of quaternary association of subunits and their functional specificity.</s><s>Using SWISS-MODEL program a stable monomer was designed by altering five amino acid residues near the C-terminus of ASAL.</s></p><p><s>Methodology/Principal Findings: By introduction of 5 site-specific mutations (-DNSNN-), a b turn was incorporated between the 11 th and 12 th b strands of subunits of ASAL, resulting in a stable monomeric mutant ASAL (mASAL).</s><s>mASAL was cloned and subsequently purified from a pMAL-c2X system.</s><s>CD spectroscopic analysis confirmed the conservation of secondary structure in mASAL.</s><s>Mannose binding assay confirmed that molecular mannose binds efficiently to both mASAL and ASAL.</s><s>In contrast to ASAL, the hemagglutination activity of purified mASAL against rabbit erythrocytes was lost.</s><s>An artificial diet bioassay of Lipaphis erysimi with mASAL displayed an insignificant level of insecticidal activity compared to ASAL.</s><s>Fascinatingly, mASAL exhibited strong antifungal activity against the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria brassicicola in a disc diffusion assay.</s><s>A propidium iodide uptake assay suggested that the inhibitory activity of mASAL might be associated with the alteration of the membrane permeability of the fungus.</s><s>Furthermore, a ligand blot assay of the membrane subproteome of R. solani with mASAL detected a glycoprotein receptor having interaction with mASAL.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions/Significance: Conversion of ASAL into a stable monomer resulted in antifungal activity.</s><s>From an evolutionary aspect, these data implied that variable quaternary organization of lectins might be the outcome of defense-related adaptations to diverse situations in plants.</s><s>Incorporation of mASAL into agronomically-important crops could be an alternative method to protect them from dramatic yield losses from pathogenic fungi in an effective manner.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Mannose binding monocot plant lectins are inherently capable of defending the organism from predators and infectious pathogens.</s><s>They possess one or more carbohydrate binding domains that bind reversibly to specific mono-or oligosaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>These carbohydrate binding domains are diverse in structure and, therefore, vary in binding specificity.</s><s>Based on the available sequence and structural information, the majority of all known plant lectins have been subdivided into seven structurally and evolutionarily related groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Among them, ''monocot mannose binding lectin'' is a wellconserved superfamily composed primarily of bulb lectins found in the plant families of Amaryllidaceae, Alliaceae, Orchidaceae, Araceae, Liliaceae and Bromeliaceae.</s><s>Despite strong sequence conservation, they typically vary in the tertiary structure and quaternary organization that provides the greatest insight into their functionality in a biological system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Incidentally, some lectins are monomeric proteins (Gastrodianin), some are stable at the dimeric level (Garlic lectin), and in some cases, the subunits associate to form tetramers (Snowdrop lectin).</s><s>Although not a universal characteristic, it has been observed that the biological roles of lectins vary considerably depending upon oligomerization features <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Dimeric lectin has specific antagonistic effects towards insects and monomers are inhibitors of fungal growth whereas tetramers exhibit an anti-retroviral property.</s><s>For instance, snowdrop lectin, or GNA (Galanthus nivalis, Amaryllidaceae), is a tetramer known to be a potent inhibitor of HIV and other retroviruses, due to its ability to bind gp120 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the major glycoprotein exposed on the surface of an HIV envelope.</s><s>In contrast, garlic lectin, which has no detectable antiretroviral activity, can bind to proteins glycosylated by high mannose such as invertase and alliinase with very high affinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and has been reported to have a controlling ability against a varied range of homopteran insect attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The structural basis for these differences in binding specificity as well as the variations in quaternary association in monocot mannose binding lectins with regards to their function is, therefore, of great interest.</s><s>Hence, an attempt has been made to address the correlation between various quaternary organizations of garlic lectin (ASAL) with their functionalities and possible evolutionary implications.</s></p><p><s>The potent insecticidal protein ASAL (Accession No. AY866499), which is isolated from the garlic leaf, is a naturally occurring homodimer wherein each subunit contains three potential mannose binding motifs made up of five amino acid residues: Gln, Asp, Asn, Val and Tyr (QDNVY).</s><s>These 5 residues comprising the polar surface of the binding pockets are completely conserved in all of the subdomains throughout this lectin super family <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The primary understanding of the structure of this super family is from analysis of tetrameric GNA and dimeric Allium sativum bulb lectin.</s><s>In all studied structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the two subunits have a b-prism II fold structure, similar to that of the snowdrop lectin, comprising three anti-parallel four-stranded b-sheets arranged as a 12-stranded bbarrel, with an approximate internal 3-fold symmetry; they assemble into a tightly-bound dimer by exchanging their C terminal b-strands to form a hybrid b-sheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>This mode, frequently referred to as the C-terminal exchange, provides a large buried area on the subunit/subunit interface through which a stable dimer is established.</s><s>At this point, the question that remains to be answered is which key factors serve as the driving forces for this quaternary association.</s><s>Identification of these factors necessitates a detailed understanding of the process of dimerization as well as the development of a stable monomeric form that illuminates the evolutionary relationship between various oligomers.</s></p><p><s>Henceforth, in our present study, we have designed experiments to unravel which secondary structural elements of ASAL are responsible for dimerization.</s><s>A computer-based homology modeling program was adopted to design a stable monomer from the dimeric form of ASAL that suggested insertion and replacement of five amino acid residues -DNSNN-in the dimeric protein.</s><s>Accordingly, five site-specific mutations were subjected at amino acids 101-105 of ASAL.</s><s>Basically, a b-turn was incorporated between the 11 th and 12 th b-strand of the protomer, leading to the formation of a stable monomer.</s><s>The novel monomeric protein was then expressed and purified using a pMAL-c2X expression vector and characterized using biophysical and biochemical tools.</s><s>Conservation of the secondary structure of mASAL was authenticated by CD spectroscopic analysis.</s><s>The mutant ASAL was tested for insecticidal activity against homopteran pests as a comparison with ASAL.</s><s>The biological activity of the mutant lectin was also analyzed against fungal pathogens that cause diseases in various crops.</s><s>An insight into the mode of action of the monomeric protein towards fungal pathogens was achieved through the use of a propidium iodide uptake assay and a ligand blot assay.</s><s>Thus, our analyses advance understanding of the correlation between the quaternary structure and function of the mannose binding lectin ASAL and its mutant form mASAL. Based on the aforementioned findings, it can be suggested that the newly designed mASAL could serve as a potential candidate for incorporation into agronomically important crop plants to protect them from fungal attack.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An insight into the mode of action of mASAL towards fungal pathogen</head><p><s>In recent past, several plant proteins have been identified as antifungal proteins and have been applied biotechnologically to protect various crop plants; these include chitinases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, hevein type proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, plant defensins <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, GAFPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, etc.</s><s>On the basis of sequence homology and oligomerization level, mASAL is very close to GAFP.</s><s>The inhibition profile of mASAL is interesting and promising from the perspective of plant biotechnology.</s><s>The results presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> demonstrate that in comparison to ASAL, mASAL alters the fungal membrane permeability.</s><s>Indeed, one could hypothesize that this alteration depends on its lectin activity, because as determined via the binding assay, mASAL was found to bind mannose efficiently.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we performed a mannose inhibition assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>) and a ligand blot assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>The data obtained from the propidium iodide uptake assay are consistent with the data from the ligand blot assay.</s><s>Both approaches strongly suggest that mASAL binds to the glycoprotein component or mannans of the fungal cell wall and thereby alters the normal cross linking activities during cell wall formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, severely affecting the growth and pathogenicity of the fungus.</s><s>Only the monomeric form is able to display such an effect due to its smaller size, which allows it to explore the glycoprotein component of the cell wall because the size exclusion for a typical antifungal protein is limited to approximately 15-20 kDa <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>It is also evident from the bioassay data that the fusion protein MBP-mASAL (54 kDa) shows no inhibitory activity against any of the tested fungi, whereas the purified mASAL is detrimental to fungal pathogens.</s><s>Finally, as determined by immunolocalization assay (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>), we can convincingly provide evidence that in comparison to ASAL, mASAL is more successful in penetrating the fungal membrane.</s><s>Additionally, a comprehensive understanding is required to identify and characterize the fungal membrane protein receptor through a functional proteomic approach in order to determine the actual mechanism of the antifungal activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that it is possible to radically change the oligomerization level of ASAL by the insertion and replacement of five residues (-DNSNN-) resulting in a stable monomeric protein variant.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, mASAL gains a potent antifungal activity against a number of important fungal pathogens.</s><s>Presumably, this altered biological activity with the altered oligomeric status provides us clues with which to hypothesize that perhaps it is the evolutionary pressure (under which plants have to survive) that might have led to the evolution of the varied quaternary organizations of a protein.</s><s>Certainly, this study has implications towards an understanding of the evolutionary relationship among monocot mannose binding lectins.</s><s>Further in-depth studies are required to resolve several questions regarding a range of quaternary organizations of this fascinating lectin super family.</s></p><p><s>The present study provides the possibility of extending the arena of utility of mannose binding proteins in the sphere of plant biotechnology.</s><s>In conclusion, the antifungal activity of this protein is promising enough to merit further investigation of its potential in biotechnology approaches to increase fungal resistance in agronomically important crop species.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Alignment analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of ASAL with closely related mannose binding homologues.Sequence alignment among ASAL, Amorphophallus paeonifolius lectin (ACL), Arum maculatum lectin (AML), Allium cepa lectin (ACAL), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and Gastrodianin (GAFP).</s><s>All identities and similarities are indicated by (*) and (:).</s><s>Blue blocks and the grey box represent all mannose binding domains and the stretch of amino acids that differ in the monomer, respectively.</s><s>The two residues at positions 98 and 99 (GNA numbering) are shown with two down triangles, where a trans-peptide bond is present in monomers instead of the cis-peptide bond found in all oligomers.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018593.g001</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,58.05,60.77,363.02,219.91" type="bitmap" /></figure>
