<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The dose-response relationship is the basis of toxicology and one of the most discussed scientific issues over the 20th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, as reported by Calabrese <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the hormetic dose-response model is the most common and fundamental model in the biological and biomedical sciences.</s><s>Currently, hormesis as a dose-response phenomenon is not only incredibly important in toxicology, but it is an intensively researched area of biology because exposure to a toxic substance in a hormetic dose upregulates adaptive mechanisms of the organism, protecting against subsequent exposures to stress factors.</s><s>Heavy metals, including lead (Pb) as an abiotic stress factor used in these studies, belong to the group of the most dangerous pollutants in ecotoxicology.</s><s>Lead-contaminated soil originating from anthropogenic sources is widespread <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and poses serious hazards to environment and human health.</s><s>Moreover, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> presented that road dust containing Pb can act as a temporary sink of metals from a variety of sources and as a source of metals contributing to atmospheric pollution through resuspension.</s><s>Pb phytotoxicity has been well documented in many plant species <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Pb can be absorbed by plants and mainly accumulates in root tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Our earlier review work reported that the presence of heavy metals at a hormetic dose in the surrounding environment affects the response of plants to biotic stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The hormesis phenomenon, also called 'priming', results in a faster and stronger induction of basal defence mechanisms upon subsequent biotic stress factors.</s><s>The induction of this adaptive response of plants to moderate environmental stressors involves several steps, such as the perception and transduction of the stress-signal, stimulation of the hormetic response at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and increase in the metabolic status of plant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Our latest research also shows the changes in the expression of genes encoding enzymes of phytohormone biosynthesis under the influence of Pb at hormetic doses and sublethal doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>From the literature data, we know that the hormetic dose response can occur as a direct stimulatory response, after an initial disruption in homeostasis followed by a modest overcompensation response, or as a response to an 'adapting' or 'pre-conditioning' dose that is followed by a stronger challenging dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The perception of aphid infestation induces highly coordinated and sequential defensive reactions in plants at the cellular and molecular levels <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</s><s>For example, elevated levels of semiquinone radicals may contribute to the build-up of a defensive barrier against aphids, i.e., these radicals may be incorporated into polymers such as lignins by combining with reactive free radicals (ROS) and could prevent the breakdown of associated cell walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The sealing of plant cell walls is extremely important because aphids insert stylets of their sucking-piercing mouthparts into leaf tissues and penetrate cells to follow the apoplastic pathway until they reach phloem sap <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>As reported by Tjallingii and Esch <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, aphid stylets pierce through the epidermis, mesophyll, as well as other parenchymatous tissues until they reach the phloem.</s><s>The factors responsible for the activation of plant defences include mechanical damage and elicitors, which are present in aphid saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in defence response signal cascades, apart from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and nitric oxide (NO), defence-related phytohormones also take part, such as JA, SA, ethylene (ET), ABA and gibberellic acid (GA).</s><s>It should also be mentioned that pisatin, a 6a-hydroxyl-pterocarpan phytoalexin in peas, is an essential element of the plant defence system.</s><s>Pisatin is relatively unique among naturally occurring pterocarpans by virtue of the (+) stereochemistry of its 6a-11a C-C bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>As reported by Cruickshank and Perrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, this pterocarpan was the first chemically identified phytoalexin.</s><s>Furthermore, Dixon <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> showed that it is a product of the isoflavonoid pathway.</s><s>As reported by Jeandet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, plants use phytoalexins as defensive substances in response to pests and pathogens.</s><s>In turn, soluble sugars, such as sucrose and its monosaccharides, can not only be the donors of the carbon skeletons for secondary metabolism but also signalling molecules regulating the expression of genes encoding isoflavonoid biosynthesis enzymes <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> and references cited in this paper.</s><s>Bolouri Moghaddam and Van den Ende <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> pay attention to the dual role of sucrose as a metabolisable transport sugar and a potential 'priming' molecule in plant defence reactions.</s></p><p><s>Foyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> noted that the plants exposed to one stressor are more susceptible to attack by herbivores and pathogens.</s><s>However, in many cases, even mild exposures to abiotic stresses trigger innate immune responses and enhance plant defences.</s><s>Therefore, in the case of impact, one stressor followed by another stressor triggers cross-tolerance phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, Rossatto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> suggest the occurrence of a phenomenon associated with memory in plants, where the pre-exposure of plants to potentially stressful conditions can stimulate tolerance to subsequent stresses.</s></p><p><s>The main goal was to determine the effect of Pb in a concentration range of 0.025-0.325</s><s>mM Pb(NO 3 ) 2 and cross-talk between Pb and A. pisum on growth parameters of pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L. cv.</s><s>Cysterski) as well as molecular and metabolic responses under the influence of these stress factors.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, apart from growth analysis, one of the goals was to determine the effect of Pb in the above range and cross-talk between Pb and A. pisum on early defensive responses, i.e., concentrations of semiquinone radicals and paramagnetic manganese (Mn 2+ ) ions and phytohormones.</s><s>The novelty of these studies is the correlation between the applied doses of Pb, cross-talk between Pb and A. pisum infestation and saccharide levels and invertase activities.</s><s>Moreover, the effects of Pb and A. pisum on the expression of genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the regulation of the pisatin biosynthetic pathway, i.e., IFS and HMM, in pea seedlings were determined.</s><s>HMM is an enzyme that catalyses the reaction of the direct transformation of 6α-hydroxymaackiain into pisatin.</s><s>Additionally, in the present work, the normality of distribution of the investigated traits was demonstrated, and relationships between the values of individual traits in organs using correlation analysis were examined.</s></p><p><s>We can hypothesise in our studies that Pb at low concentrations can trigger hormetic responses, enhancing plant growth and the activities of invertases, which are enzymes that metabolise sucrose into its monosaccharides.</s><s>In turn, soluble sugars are carbon skeleton donors for secondary metabolism via which pisatin biosynthesis occurs.</s><s>Moreover, a hormetic dose can cause molecular and metabolic changes in relation to semiquinone radicals and paramagnetic Mn 2+ ions, phytohormones, soluble sugars and pisatin levels.</s><s>Additionally, changes in the soluble sugar level in plant cells will affect gene expression encoding IFS and HMM, which play a key role in the biosynthesis of pisatin.</s></p><p><s>Our research is important because the pea aphid (A.</s><s>pisum) as a biotic stress factor is widely used in laboratory studies and is one of the key pests of pulse crops worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The broad host (pea, clover, alfalfa and broad bean) range of the pea aphid <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, complex life cycle, including both sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and flexibility in adapting to different environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> make it difficult to control this pest.</s><s>The pea aphid is closely related to important crop pests, including the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) and the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia).</s><s>A. pisum is a serious concern for commercial pulse producers because it can injure the crops directly by removing sap from leaves, stems and pods and indirectly by acting as a vector for over 30 plant viruses, including cucumber mosaic virus, beet yellows virus, pea enation mosaic virus and bean leafroll virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The International Aphid Genomics Consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> analysis of the pea aphid genome has begun to reveal the genetic underpinnings of this animal's complex ecology, including its capacity to parasitise agricultural crops, its association with microbial symbionts and its developmental patterning.</s></p><p><s>Air and soil pollution, including heavy metals, can affect plant-insect relationships directly or indirectly, can be toxic or cause the hormesis effect and can change their behaviour and metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, this study is valuable, especially in the era of global climate change (GCC), where an increase in the temperature accelerates the development of crop pests.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>Changes in the molecular and metabolic responses of pea seedlings depend on the duration of exposure to the stress factor, direct contact of the stress factor with the organ and its concentration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">8</ref>; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>We have demonstrated that Pb at a low concentration caused the hormesis effect, which was visible through the stimulated growth of the epicotyl.</s><s>In turn, Pb at high concentrations caused a sublethal effect, which was manifested by the limitation of growth.</s><s>The level of semiquinone radicals, paramagnetic Mn 2+ ions and the main defence-related phytohormones, such as ABA, JA and SA, depended on the dose of Pb and the impact of a single stress factor or the combined impact of two stress factors.</s><s>Pea aphid infestation caused signal induction and its transfer from leaves to roots.</s><s>Additionally, pisatin levels increased under the influence of the sublethal doses of Pb and as a result of cross-talk between Pb and pea aphid infestation.</s><s>This result was related to the high sucrose and glucose contents in the variants with sublethal doses.</s><s>The high invertase activities in the hormetic dose variants and the high glucose levels at early time points indicate that this monosaccharide may be involved in the plant defence response against pea aphid feeding.</s><s>In the present study, we also revealed a significant induction of the expression of genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of pisatin, such as IFS and HMM.</s><s>It should be emphasised that in the roots of pea seedlings, a sublethal dose of Pb and cross-talk between a sublethal dose of Pb and aphid infestation strongly upregulated the tested genes.</s><s>In turn, in the leaves of pea seedlings from the hormetic and sublethal doses of Pb as well as during aphid feeding, high levels of transcripts for IFS and HMM were demonstrated.</s><s>The results of our analyses presented in this study will improve understanding of plant-aphid interactions under various heavy metal (Pb ) contamination levels.</s></p><p><s>Int.
