<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major food crop in Asia.</s><s>However, it also serves as an important food source for insects and is attacked by around 800 species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Of these insects, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)), the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera (Horváth)), and the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén)) are three major destructive pests in rice ecosystems.</s><s>They belong to Hemiptera: Delphacidae and go through five nymphal stages to become adults.</s><s>Among them, N. lugens is a monophagous pest that feeds only on rice plants, whereas S. furcifera and L. striatellus are oligophagous pests, feeding mainly on rice plants but also on many other Gramineae plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>These species damage rice plants through inserting their styles into the vascular tissue of leaf blades and leaf sheaths and ingesting the sap, causing a colossal loss in yield, the transmittance of virus diseases, and also making the plants vulnerable to bacterial and fungal attacks.</s><s>Heavy infestation can cause the complete drying and wilting of plants, known as "hopperburn" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the extensive but unplanned applications of insecticides, almost all strains of these pests have become resistant through adaptive mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, in order to develop alternative and novel strategies to control insect pests that are as equally effective as conventional insecticides without affecting the environment, it is necessary to explore and understand the molecular mechanisms of pest biology and the dynamic interactions between plant and pest.</s></p><p><s>Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an oligomeric Ser/Thr protein kinase that is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>CaMKII mediates the Ca 2+ signaling by phosphorylating a wide variety of substrate proteins involved in multiple important physiological and pathological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In Blattella germanica, the expression of CaMKII mRNA in DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) or pyrethroid-resistant strains was lower than that in susceptible ones, this reduction indicates that CaMKII may play important roles in DDT or pyrethroid resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, it was demonstrated that increasing the level of constitutively active CaMKII decreased the initial courtship and enhanced the rate of the suppression of courtship in response to a mated female.</s><s>This effect could be mediated by cholinergic neurons that enhance training-dependent suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>In Bombyx mori, it was found that a species-specific sex pheromone released by female moths to attract conspecific male moths is regulated by a neurohormone.</s><s>The signal pathway of the neurohormone involves phosphorylation by CaMKII <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In Helicoverpa armigera, CaMKII showed an increased expression and phosphorylation during metamorphosis.</s><s>CaMKII knockdown by dsCaMKII injection into the larvae prevented the occurrence of larval-pupal transition and suppressed the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) response gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The importance of CaMKII in holometabolous insects and neuronal processes is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There exists a diversity of CaMKII isoforms in mammals, four CaMKII genes in humans, termed α, β, γ, and δ, give rise to 40 isoforms through alternative splicing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>For Drosophila <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> and Periplaneta americana <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, up to nine and five closely related isoforms were identified, respectively, which are encoded by the alternative splicing of a single gene.</s><s>CaMKII in Drosophila is 77% identical to the rat α subunit, which is distributed only in neurons and expressed at high levels in forebrain neurons and is known to play important roles in the developmental and physiological modulation of the nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>To date, little is known about the number of CaMKII isoforms, tissue distribution, and their potential function in hemimetabolous insects.</s><s>Thus, in the present study, we cloned, sequenced, and characterized the tissue-distribution pattern of CaMKII isoforms in three rice planthopper species.</s><s>Additionally, the RNAi efficiency of NlCaMKII by injecting dsRNA into the insect body and the nymph lethality of the RNAi in N. lugens were analyzed.</s></p></div>
