citri were dissected and prepared for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>TEM examination of thin sections showed abundant virus-like particles typical of reoviruses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>The particles appeared spherical, approximately 70 nm in diameter, and possessed a double-layered shell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1BI</ref>).</s><s>They were composed of an electron-dense central core and a capsid of moderate electron density, which corresponded to the morphology of reovirus virions.</s><s>These were distributed throughout all tissues and organs, including the gut, fat bodies, salivary glands, and female and male reproductive systems (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>They were often aggregated into crystalline arrays of various sizes, sometimes scattered in a free form throughout the cytoplasm, distributed at the periphery or inside the electron-dense viroplasms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Some particles were also found in vesicular compartments in the vicinity of the cell membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1BVI</ref>).</s><s>About 20 D. citri insects were examined to better understand the distribution and form of virions in different organs (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Immunoelectron microscopy showed that specific IgG of P8, the predicted major outer capsid protein encoded by the S8 genome segment of DcRV, specifically recognized these particles, such as the free virions in the cytoplasm and the intact particles within the viroplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>The P8-specific IgG also reacted specifically with the matrix of the viroplasm, which was consistent with the fact that viral proteins were produced in the viroplasm.</s><s>The immunofluorescence microscopy showed that P8-specific

(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>DcRV is transmitted in a vertical manner.</s><s>To understand the manner of DcRV transmission, we assessed the DcRV incidence in our caged D. citri organisms (Hawaiian population).</s><s>RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays showed 100% of D. citri insects were infected, and the mean viral genome copies in adults of infected D. citri insects was 5.65 ϫ 10 8 copies/g RNA (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material).</s><s>The fieldcollected D. citri insects collected in Hawaii had mean viral genome copies of 1.25 ϫ 10 8 copies/g RNA (Data Set S1).</s><s>To determine whether DcRV could be horizontally transmitted among D. citri insects, we next used oral and injection approaches in attempts to transmit DcRV.</s><s>Because the Hawaiian population of D. citri was 100% DcRV infected, we used the California D. citri population, which we first determined to be DcRV free, as the recipient.</s><s>We first used membrane feeding using California D. citri with a crude DcRV virion preparation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2AI</ref>).</s><s>Second, we allowed uninfected California D. citri and DcRV-infected Hawaii D. citri insects to feed through a shared artificial diet, a "kiss model," for 5 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2AII</ref>).</s><s>For both assays, the recipient

DcRV picked up by the California D. citri insects feeding on leaves, likely residual virions in the alimentary canal.</s><s>Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the California D. citri insects could not be infected by DcRV via oral acquisition.</s><s>It was also revealed that DcRV could not infect the Citrus macrophylla plant.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether DcRV could infect other plants, the orange jessamine (Murraya paniculata L.), another species that is closely related to Citrus and which is a preferred host for D. citri, was chosen.</s><s>DcRV-infected D. citri insects were allowed to feed on the new leaves on flush shoots of orange jessamine plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2BI</ref>).</s><s>The result from RT-PCR detection showed that both the new and feeding leaves were DcRV negative (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2BII</ref>), indicating that DcRV could not infect the orange jessamine plants.</s></p><p><s>As a final attempt to infect California D. citri with DcRV, we performed intrathoracic injection into California D. citri insects using a crude DcRV extract from Hawaii D. citri.</s><s>At 5 days postinoculation (dpi), the organs of the injected D. citri insects, including the alimentary canal and reproductive systems, were dissected and analyzed by RT-qPCR.</s><s>These results showed that level of the P8 gene increased 44-fold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), suggesting that California D. citri insects were susceptible to DcRV and could be infected by microinjection.</s><s>At 10 dpi, the relative accumulation levels of the P8 gene increased up to 171-fold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>We subsequently monitored this DcRV-injected colony for 20 generations and found that the infection rate of each generation was 100%, showing that DcRV could stably infect California D. citri for generations.</s><s>Taking these results together, we confirmed that DcRV was infectious and infected both Californian and Hawaiian D. citri but was not orally acquired.</s></p><p><s>DcRV incidence of 100% in DcRV-infected colonies suggested that it must be readily

cells were inoculated with recombinant baculovirus that encoded P10 fused with a His tag.</s><s>As seen by immunofluorescence microscopy, at 48 h postinfection (hpi) the P10 protein was associated with filament-like structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>), corresponding in size and morphology to the expression of tubule-associated protein of plant-infecting reoviruses in

of newly emerged adults showed small ovarioles and oocytes, which were at the previtellogenic stage (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy showed abundant P10 tubules

delayed the development of ovaries but also inhibited the viral accumulation in eggs, revealing that the vitellogenic stage was important for viral infection in oocytes.</s><s>Because we observed virion-containing P10 tubules in oocytes at the vitellogenic stage, we suggest that the vitellogenic stage is important for P10 entering the oocyte.</s><s>Therefore, we confirmed that P10 was

of D. citri using small RNA and transcriptome sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesized that these sequences were representative of infectious viruses, and here we determined that DcRV is an infectious virus and was transmissible via injection to naive D. citri insects.</s><s>We identified virions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) showing the morphology and structural characteristics of viruses in the Reoviridae <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Phylogenetic comparisons suggested DcRV was most similar to NLRV, a tentative member of the genus Fijivirus (3).</s><s>Most viruses in the genus Fijivirus are dual-host viruses, infecting the insect vectors as well as plants hosts.</s><s>However, NLRV is so far only known to infect planthoppers, specifically Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Heteroptera: Delphacidae), but the virus can move through rice plants without replicating and then be acquired by and infect healthy N. lugens insects feeding on other parts of the same plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>We found no evidence that DcRV could infect citrus and/or orange jessamine plants, and transmission experiments showed that although DcRV was delivered by DcRV-infected Hawaiian D. citri to the plants via feeding, it could not replicate and/or move in leaves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, DcRV was not transmissible to naive Californian D. citri insects via oral acquisition (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) but was transmissible by injection and via sexual transmission, and it was maintained in the population by 100% transovarial transmission to progeny.</s><s>In our studies, DcRV showed no obvious pathogenicity to infected D. citri; thus, it might be an insect-specific virus, such as Leafhopper A virus (LAV), Peregrinus maidis virus (PgMV), Drosophila S virus (DSV), and NLRV <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Transovarial transmission in vertical transmission.</s><s>Vertical transmission is a crucial strategy for the persistence of viruses in insect populations.</s><s>This can involve viral integration into the host genome, maternal transmission through eggs, and/or paternal transmission through sperm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>For the vertical transmission of viruses, all the sigma viruses and DSV in Drosophila have been found to be passed to progeny by biparental transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>We showed here that DcRV was transmitted in a biparental manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We found 100% transovarial transmission from DcRV-infected females, and because DcRV can be transmitted via DcRV-infected males to uninfected females, this serves as the means for spread into uninfected D. citri populations.</s></p><p><s>Maternal transmission of insect viruses involves transovarial transmission and transovum transmission.</s><s>The former refers to the inheritance resulting from motheroriginating virus infecting the developing oocytes.</s><s>This has been shown for several viruses, including orthobunyaviruses, insect-specific flaviviruses, and mosquitotransmitted arboviruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, transovum transmission refers to the mother-originating viral passage through contamination of the exterior egg surface.</s><s>This has been shown for some viruses, including the Lepidoptera-infecting nuclear polyhedrosis virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>NLRV, to which DcRV was most closely phylogenetically related, was shown to be passed in a transovum manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we found DcRV was transovarially transmitted.</s><s>DcRV-infected mothers could give 100% infection in the progeny.</s><s>This ability of DcRV transovarial transmission appears to be one of the greatest among the known insect-borne viruses.</s><s>During viral transovarial transmission in insects, the important processes are the invasion of viral particles into the oocytes and the production of infectious virions, resulting in infection of the unfertilized egg <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>In some examples virions appear to be carried by the insect protein Vg to infect the germarium or oocytes of

(RGDV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, by using immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we found that P10 tubules carried virions to oocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>When we knocked down P10 by RNAi in females, this not only suppressed the viral spread and accumulation but also reduced the viral accumulation in eggs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>It is necessary to mention that the relative accumulation of P10 and P8 genes recovered to normal levels at 14 days after dsP10 treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>The relative expression of the Vg gene also showed a similar increase at 14 days after dsVg treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>These increases of relative accumulation of target genes likely reflect the recovery of virus replication as the RNAi effects wear down over time.</s><s>We found that in the dsVg treatment, while the relative accumulation of P10 was still reduced after 8 dpi, the relative accumulation of P8 in ovaries and eggs was increased.</s><s>It is assumed that some unknown compensation for the pathway of virus entering eggs is launched when P10 is inhibited, for example, when the free virions enter the eggs.</s><s>We also found that the relative accumulation of P8 RNA showed a profile similar to that of P10 RNA in dsP10 treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>), suggesting that the knockdown of P10 expression not only blocked the formation of tubules but also affected overall DcRV replication/accumulation.</s><s>These results once again provided evidence for the fact that each viral protein was essential for viral infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>The same results were found for the relative accumulation of P8 RNA in eggs, indicating that knockdown of P10 in the females also affected the amount of DcRV passed from females to the eggs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>P10 appeared to contribute to transovarial transmission of DcRV during vitellogenesis.</s><s>Based on the result that P10 served as a facilitator and safe vehicle for viral spread and secondary infection, virion-containing P10 tubules could not spread to the previtellogenic ovarioles first (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>); thus, DcRV virions may not be able to infect ovarioles at previtellogenic stages.</s><s>In general, at the vitellogenic stage, the period of rapid oocyte growth and yolk deposition, the follicular cells on the surface of the oocytes shrink <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>The gaps between follicular cells appear and provide free access of the hemolymph to the surface of the oocyte, because the only potential barrier, the tunica propria, is permeable to large molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we found that this specific stage was utilized by the P10 tubules, which inserted into the gap and penetrated to the oocytes, for efficient viral delivery.</s></p><p><s>The Vg, forming the major egg yolk protein called vitellin, is mostly female specific, although small amounts are found in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>It is derived from fat bodies and ovarian follicular cells of female adults and preferentially taken up by the oocyte during vitellogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>Because Vg has the ability to enter the oocyte, it was unknown whether the oocyte-entering path of P10 tubules was associated with Vg deposition.</s><s>However, the knockdown of Vg inhibited DcRV spread and accumulation in females and DcRV infection of eggs.</s><s>This result highlights the important role of the vitellogenic stage for DcRV infection and P10 spread in oocytes.</s></p><p><s>Paternal transmission.</s><s>To our knowledge, paternal transmission is less common among pathogens and endosymbionts of insects, and we know relatively little about it.</s><s>Most bacteria are transmitted in a maternal mode, and relatively few viruses have been described to be transmitted via sperm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>The most well-documented paternal transmission is for sigma virus, a rhabdovirus infecting dipterans <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>The virions of Drosophila melanogaster sigma virus (DMelSV) are detected in sperm cells of adult Drosophila melanogaster insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, and here we found that DcRV can exploit sperm for paternal transmission.</s><s>We showed that DcRV could be passed in relatively low efficiency from males to progeny for vertical transmission and even to females for horizontal transmission.</s><s>This could be important for DcRV spread to naive populations, because we found no evidence for oral acquisition as a means of transmission.</s><s>If a male D. citri mates with an uninfected female, DcRV will infect only about 8% of the offspring.</s><s>However, once a female D. citri insect is DcRV infected, the virus will be passed to 100% of the next generation.</s></p><p><s>After mating, the sperm are stored and maintained in the spermatheca of the female <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>When the eggs pass down the oviduct, the sperm are released from the spermatheca for fertilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>The crossing experiments of female (Californian uninfected) ϫ male (Hawaiian DcRV infected) and RNAi experiments revealed that postmating, DcRV initially failed to spread and infect the reproductive systems of females, but the eggs were infected.</s><s>This suggests that the eggs were directly infected by DcRV-infected sperm during fertilization, whereas ovaries of approximately 20% of the females became infected at a later time after mating, indicating that the DcRV was from the infected sperm and invaded other tissues of the fertilized females.</s></p><p><s>When the details of DcRV paternal transmission were explored, we found DcRV virion-containing tubules in males.</s><s>Virions packaged in P10 tubules were capable of binding sperm, resulting in DcRV infection of some progeny and the recipient females.</s><s>It was unclear whether the association of P10 with sperm was physical binding or a specific protein-protein interaction, but it may represent a unique means for DcRV to utilize nonstructural proteins in male insects for vertical and horizontal transmission.</s><s>Other viruses which are able to exploit the sperm for viral transmission are usually limited to the infection of sperm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</s><s>The sperm-associated spread of DcRV via tubules might be less stable, because the exterior binding of tubules has a potential risk of loss and damage during mating.</s><s>This might explain the reasons that the efficiency of DcRV paternal transmission was lower than that of other paternally transmitted viruses, such as the sigma viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref>.</s><s>For the transovarial transmission, the spread of mother-originated DcRV and infection of oocytes occurred in the same individual, while for the paternal transmission, it was two different individuals that DcRV passed through, from the spread of sperm-associated P10 tubules to the viral delivery in females.</s><s>The risk of loss and damage of P10 tubules from males to females was certainly higher than that in females, which may also cause the inefficiency of paternal transmission of DcRV compared with that of transovarial transmission.</s></p><p><s>Tubule-associated proteins of reoviruses.</s><s>Many plant-infecting reoviruses encode proteins which assemble into virion-packaging tubular structures in virus-infected insect vectors <ref type="bibr">(12-14, 46, 47)</ref>.</s><s>Because of their ability to allow for virion transport between cells, this efficient tool utilized by plant reoviruses overcomes the tissue and membrane barriers in the insect vector.</s><s>For the NLRV, the virus most closely related to DcRV, it is unclear which, or if, any genome segments encode a protein that could form virion-containing tubules.</s><s>In this study, we found that the P10 protein of DcRV, which is closest to the NLRV P10, possessed the properties of a tubule-associated protein, including the predicted hydrophobic region, and the capability of assembling into virion-containing tubular structures of approximately 90 nm in diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The tubules formed by DcRV P10 were widely distributed in most organs of D. citri insects.</s><s>It has been suggested that it is universal for insect-borne reoviruses to encode proteins which could assemble into virion-packaging tubular structures for viral spread in insects.</s></p><p><s>Besides tubules contributing to the viral intercellular spread in the epithelial cells, DcRV P10 tubules also were associated with the delivery of viral particles to the oocytes, which corresponds with the function of Pns11 tubules derived from the plant reovirus RGDV in leafhoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, DcRV is the second virus which has been found to exploit a virus-encoded protein that assists in transovarial transmission.</s><s>We also found that the oocyte-entering function of DcRV tubules was closely related to the development of ovaries (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>We could not clarify whether the development of insects facilitates the viral spread or whether DcRV takes advantage of insect growth and development.</s><s>DcRV tubules were associated with sperm for viral delivery in viral paternal transmission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>Among the reoviruses, so far no virus-encoded tubuleassociated proteins have been found to have an ability to bind sperm.</s><s>In conclusion, our results reveal a pivotal role for a nonstructural protein in biparental transmission of a novel insect virus.</s></p></div>
