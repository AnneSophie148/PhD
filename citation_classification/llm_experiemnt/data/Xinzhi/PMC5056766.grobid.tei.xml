<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uptake of phage by bean plants and acquisition by GWSSs</head><p><s>Standard quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) line plots obtained for phage Paz had an R 2 value greater than 0.9 and efficiency of 123%.</s><s>Stems immersed in phage suspensions showed an average level of phage of (3 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 8 plaque forming units (PFU)/gram of plant tissue (gpt) and (2 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 8 PFU/gpt after 4h and 48h, respectively, in 2 independent experiments.</s><s>GWSSs allowed to feed on stems immersed in a phage Paz solution showed efficient acquisition of phage, exhibiting (2 Â§ 0.4) Â£ 10 6 PFU/GWSS (1 Â§ 0.4 Â£10 8 PFU/gm of GWSS tissue [gGWt]) phage after feeding for 48h, in 2 independent experiments.</s><s>No phages were detected in GWSSs or bean plants immersed in sterile distilled water (SDW) in both experiments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phage transmission by GWSSs</head><p><s>Once the ability of GWSSs to acquire phage from stems was established, it was of interest to determine if the phage harboring GWSSs could transfer phage to plants.</s><s>GWSSs were allowed to feed on stems harboring an average of (2 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 8 PFU/gpt.</s><s>GWSSs assayed after feeding for 48h harbored an average of (2 Â§ 0.4) Â£ 10 6 PFU/GWSS (1 Â§ 0.4 Â£ 10 8 PFU/ gGWt).</s><s>Cowpea stems, on which the phage harboring GWSSs were allowed to feed for a 48h period, showed an average of (3 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 2 PFU/gpt, and assayed GWSSs contained (3 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 3 PFU/GWSS (1 Â§ 0.3 Â£ 10 5 PFU/gGWt), respectively.</s><s>No phages were detected in GWSSs or stems from control set of SDW.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Sharpshooter leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopidae), both xylem fluid-feeding leafhoppers are the primary vectors for dispersal of Xf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> The recent establishment of the GWSS (Homalodisca vitripennis) in California now threatens the major portion of wine and table grape production in the US. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Previous vector studies with GWSSs have focused on the acquisition and transmission of Xf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> In these studies, the GWSSs were allowed to feed on infected tissue and then allowed to feed on non-infected tissue to qualitatively determine acquisition and the transfer efficiency.</s><s>Almeida <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> found that adult GWSSs acquired and transferred Xf within less than one hour of access time on grapevine tissue, but observed that acquisition efficiency did not increase beyond 6h access and that estimated inoculation efficiency per GWSS decreased over a 4 day period.</s><s>Bextine 17 developed an artificial system using parafilm to study leafhopper-borne pathogen acquisition and transmission of Xff.</s><s>Using this model, he found that a lower transmission rate to chrysanthemum stems was associated with longer times of inoculation access period.</s><s>We have previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> that weed and plant extracts yielded 10-10 5 PFU/gpt of Xylella phages without detection of Xf by either direct plating or by qRT-PCR, and noted the Xanthomonas isolates that could also act as hosts were isolated from the extracts.</s><s>Our experience with the isolation of phages from petioles obtained from field samples indicates that phages are present at very low levels in vines, since we were not able to detect phages by direct plating, but were able to enrich samples for Xf phages.</s><s>It has been documented that Xf is transferred by the polyphagous feeding activity of the GWSS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> and we speculate that phages present in weeds and other host plant reservoirs are also transferred by the same activity.</s><s>We have presented quantitative data for the uptake of phage Paz by immersed plant stems and the efficient acquisition of the phage by GWSSs from the phage harboring stems.</s><s>We have expressed the uptake in terms of PFU/gpt and on average plant uptake was (3 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 8 PFU/gpt and (2 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 8 PFU/gpt after 4h and 48h, respectively.</s><s>When GWSSs were allowed to feed on the plant tissue, acquisition was quantitated at (2 Â§ 0.4) Â£ 10 6 PFU/ GWSS (1 Â§ 0.4 Â£ 10 8 PFU/gGWt) indicating high efficiency of acquisition.</s><s>However, when the phage harboring GWSSs were transferred to bean stems immersed in SDW and allowed to feed over a 48h period the phage PFU decreased 1000-fold.</s><s>The observed reduction in the PFU is most likely the result of feeding activity, since GWSSs ingest 100 to 300 times their dry body weight in xylem fluid per day that is excreted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s>uring this same period, transfer was quantified to bean stems at an average of (3 Â§ 0.3) Â£ 10 2 PFU/gpt indicating that while the uptake of phage is highly efficient when the phage is present in high concentration, there is an apparent dilution effect due to feeding activity resulting in low transfer of phage by GWSSs.</s><s>The results correlate with our experience of not being able to isolate phages from direct plating of extracts from field trapped GWSSs, but being able to enrich for Xf phages from the same samples using a permissive host.</s><s>This indicates that phages are present in field GWSSs at very low levels (&lt;Â»4 PFU/gGWt), and are therefore not efficiently transferred by GWSSs.</s></p><p><s>As phages are implemented as biocontrol agents we must understand their potential for transfer by vectors.</s><s>In greenhouses studies, we have reported that phages persist in vines for up to 12 weeks in the absence of a host and increase in the presence of a host. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>We have also reported that Xff phages have low adsorption constants for their host of (4.33 Â§ 0.28) Â£ 10 Â¡12 ml cell Â¡1 min Â¡1 , which is the lowest reported for a phage with its plaque-permissive host. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>The adsorption rate is affected by both phage and host concentrations because the rate of phage particle disappearance is defined as dP/dt D -kBP, where B is the concentration of bacteria, P is the concentration of free phage at any time (t), and k is the adsorption rate constant in ml cell Â¡1 min Â¡1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref></s><s>As we have observed in our greenhouse studies, Xff and phage can exist in the vascular tissue of a vine at low levels.</s><s>The implementation of phage therapy shifts the equilibrium through the introduction of high numbers of phage, which reduces the susceptible pathogen population below a critical level, and disease is not observed.</s></p><p><s>Phage-based biocontrol system using lytic phages of Xff is an alternative strategy to methods currently being used for control of PD.</s><s>Phages are clearly ubiquitous in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> and our studies show that Xff phages population vary from habitat to habitat.</s><s>More research is needed to address the phage-vector-pathogen interaction and to understand the role that lytic phages may play in the ecology of Xf.</s></p></div>
