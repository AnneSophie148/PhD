<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p><s>The small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fall√©n), is one of the major rice pests in Asia and has developed resistance to multiple classes of insecticides.</s><s>Understanding resistance mechanisms is essential to the management of this pest.</s><s>Biochemical and molecular assays were performed in this study to systematically characterize deltamethrin resistance mechanisms with laboratory-selected resistant and susceptible strains of SBPH.</s></p><p><s>Methodology/Principal Findings: Deltamethrin resistant strains of SBPH (JH-del) were derived from a field population by continuously selections (up to 30 generations) in the laboratory, while a susceptible strain (JHS) was obtained from the same population by removing insecticide pressure for 30 generations.</s><s>The role of detoxification enzymes in the resistance was investigated using synergism and enzyme activity assays with strains of different resistant levels.</s><s>Furthermore, 71 cytochrome P450, 93 esterases and 12 glutathione-S-transferases cDNAs were cloned based on transcriptome data of a field collected population.</s><s>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR screening analysis of 176 identified detoxification genes demonstrated that multiple P450 and esterase genes were overexpressed (&gt;2fold) in JH-del strains (G4 and G30) when compared to that in JHS, and the results of quantitative PCR coincided with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR results.</s><s>Target mutation at IIS3-IIS6 regions encoded by the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was ruled out for conferring the observed resistance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion/Significance:</head><p><s>As the first attempt to discover genes potentially involved in SBPH pyrethroid resistance, this study putatively identified several candidate genes of detoxification enzymes that were significantly overexpressed in the resistant strain, which matched the synergism and enzyme activity testing.</s><s>The biochemical and molecular evidences suggest that the high level pyrethroid resistance in L. striatellus could be due to enhanced detoxification rather than target insensitivity.</s><s>The findings lay a solid ground for further resistance mechanism elucidation studies.</s></p></div>

target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Among them, elucidating insecticide resistance mechanisms is crucially important in sustainable pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pyrethroids are a major insecticide class that accounts for approximately one-fourth of the world insecticide market because of their fast acting, broad spectrum

vectors of human and animal diseases worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, pyrethroid resistance has been documented in many pest species <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies revealed that at least two major types of mechanisms were associated with pyrethroid resistance.</s><s>They are (i) enhanced detoxification enzymes that degrade or sequester insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and (ii) target insensitivity brought by changes of target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>For example, pyrethroid knockdown resistance is associated with amino acid mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (target site of pyrethroids) in many species including Blattella germanica, Musca domestica and Tuta absoluta <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Insects rely heavily on three families of enzymes to disarm toxic xenobiotics including insecticides.</s><s>They are esterases (ESTs), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A typical characteristic of pyrethroid metabolic resistance is overexpression of detoxification genes at transcription level <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, resulting in increased protein amounts and enzyme activities that lead to higher level of detoxification and development of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The advances of genome sequencing technology have

acephate-resistant Lygus lineolaris <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Genome-wide screen for overexpressed candidate genes becomes an effective approach in detecting and understanding pyrethroid resistance.</s><s>Although an empirical link between upregulated detoxification genes and resistance can be doubtful, previous studies have proven that gene overexpression is indeed the cause of resistance.</s><s>For instance, overexpressed CYP6CM1vQ in Bemisia tabaci conferred high levels of imidacloprid resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Overexpressed

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Development of insecticide resistance has greatly compromised the management of L. striatelus, which relies heavily on insecticides including pyrethroids.</s><s>For example, the failures of control failures of two field population in Jiangsu province, China were attributed to 21.0-and 108.8 -fold pyrethroid resistance in two field populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s>The field population (F-G1) used in our study also showed 63.7-fold deltamethrin resistance when compared with JHS, a recovered susceptible population after 30 generations of non-insecticide exposure.</s><s>The breeding process of the resistant and susceptible strains from F-G1 revealed that L. striatelus has an capability of developing high level resistance to deltamethrin under long-term selection pressure (30 generations), and also could recover their susceptibility in the absent of insecticide pressure in a relatively faster pace (~20 generations).</s><s>These observations suggested that the deltamethrin resistance had certain fitness cost and could be beneficial in resistance management strategies.</s><s>Furthermore, the established resistant and susceptible strains by such breeding scheme shared a common genetic background separated only by deltamethrin selection, and are well suited materials for comparative analysis to reveal resistance mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>Increasing detoxification or sequestration of insecticides before reaching target sites or reducing binding of insecticide to its target through target site mutation are two major insecticide resistance mechanisms and are well documented in many insects and other arthropod species <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Enhancement of P450 and esterase activity had been found to be a major mechanism for pyrethroid resistance in many species, e.g.</s><s>Helicoverpa armigera <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, Spodoptera litura <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, Rhipicephalus bursa <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and Boophilus microplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s>Metabolic resistance can be studied at different levels.</s><s>Biochemical level studies could reveal what kinds of enzymes may be involved, and studies at molecular level could aid elucidations of the genes that encode the responsible detoxification enzymes.</s><s>Accumulation of such type of knowledge is a key to the developing of accurate molecular monitoring methods and high efficient management strategies for mitigating resistance problem.</s><s>The current study reports our effort to understand the high level deltamethrin resistance mechanisms in SBPH with an all-level approach.</s></p><p><s>The significant synergistic effects of PBO and TPP suggested that the resistance to deltamethrin in L. striatelus was partially due to enhanced P450 monooxygenases and/or esterase activities.</s><s>The biochemical assays confirmed indeed that the resistant individuals had higher level of P450 and general esterase activities compared with susceptible individuals.</s><s>The fact that JH-del having cross resistance with other pyrethroid, carbamate and organophosphate insecticides (RR=259-2.14,</s><s>Lu Xu, unpublished data) also support a metabolic resistance mechanism.</s><s>Furthermore, target site amino acid polymorphisms were detected in our SBPH strains, and one of amino acid substitutions (M918V) has been identified as a mutation associated with pyrethroid (fenpropathrin) resistance in Bemisia tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s>But the frequency of the identified substitutions in current study was very low (1/10).</s><s>Therefore, possible involvement of mutations in the para gene (the voltage-gated sodium channel) segment containing kdr and super-kdr sites was ruled out in JH-del, though possible mutations outside the IIS3-IIS6 regions need to be check further.</s><s>Nevertheless, multiple evidences point to a metabolic resistance mechanism involving elevated P450 and esterase activity.</s></p><p><s>Using the transcriptome data of L. striatellus, we identified 176 detoxification genes (71 P450, 39 carboxyesterase, 54 phosphoesterase and 12 GST) and their expressions were proved by normal RT-PCR.</s><s>The number of P450 genes found was similar to those reported for Daphnia pulex (75), D. melanogaster (85) and Bombyx mori (86), but less than that reported in Tribolium castaneum (143) and A. aegypti (164).</s><s>The number of carboxyesteras genes found was more than that in Apis mellifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, and less than that in An. gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</s><s>The number of GST genes was more than that in Ap. mellifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and less than in D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> and An.</s><s>gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>.</s><s>Those comparisons suggested that we have identified the majority of the detoxification genes in L. striatellus.</s><s>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qPCR revealed that five P450 and one esterase genes were overexpressed by 2-24 folds higher in the resistant strain of L. striatellus.</s><s>Of the five elevated P450s, two belong to the CYP6 family and the other 3 belong to the CYP314, CYP353 and CYP439 families, respectively.</s><s>CYP6 family was more frequently found involving in insecticide resistance than any other P450 family <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>For example, CYP6A1 and CYP6A36 in Musca domestica resistant to DDT, organophosphates, pyrethroids and juvenile hormone analogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>; CYP6A2 and CYP6A8 in Drosophilas resistant to DDT, diazinon and cyclodienes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>; CYP6AE11 in Helicoverpa armigera resistant to deltamethrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>; CYP6F1 in C. quinquefasciatus and C. pipiens pallens resistant to pyrethroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, a gene in CYP6 family (CYP6CW1) was found to be upregulated in a buprofezin resistant L. striatellus population <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In our work, CYP6AY3v2 and CYP6FU1 were significantly overexpressed (16 and 24 folds) in the L. striatellus resistant strain (JH-del) implying possible roles in deltamethrin resistance.</s><s>However, the expression levels of other three P450 genes also showed 2-5-folds higher in JH-del.</s><s>Multiple P450 families other than CYP6 have been implicated in pyrethroid resistance, e.g.</s><s>CYP325C1 in pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles stephensi <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, CYP325 in C. quinquefasciatus resistant to permethrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; CYP332A1 and CYP337B1 in H. armigera resistant to fenvalerate <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and CYP314A1 in An. gambiae resistant to DDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</s><s>Overexpressed CYP 4 and 9 also were reported to confer pyrethroid resistance.</s><s>For example, CYP4H21, CYP4H22, CYP4H23, CYP4J4, and CYP4J6 in deltamethrin resistant C. p. pallens <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, CYP9A12 and CYP9A14 in a fenvalerate resistant H. armigera <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and CYP9M10 and CYP4H34 in permethrin resistant C. quinquefasciatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, elevated GST activity also has been associated with pyrethroid resistant previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</s><s>However, a role of GSTs in deltamethrin resistant SBPH cannot be demonstrated in either synergism bioassays, or enzyme activity assays, or gene expression analysis of the current study.</s><s>These results suggested that metabolic insecticide resistance is a complex process that could involve various enzyme families, number of genes expressed, and different expression patterns in different resistance strains of different species.</s><s>We should also point out that overproduction of P450 does not necessarily associate with insecticide resistance.</s><s>It is possible that there is a common transcriptional factor regulating expression levels of several P450 genes, or a mutation occurred in this transcriptional factor that causes a concomitant overproduction of P450 genes.</s></p><p><s>A total of 19 genes were overexpressed in JH-del-G4, but only 6 genes were overexpressed in JH-del.</s><s>This phenomenon may be explained by more diverse resistance background of JH-del-G4 with only 4 generations of selection.</s><s>As the selection continued, the population became more homozygous with simpler genetic background and less number of genes involved.</s><s>This finding provides additional evidence that the identified overexpressed genes are responsible for the observed higher level deltamethrin resistance.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, our study provides an example that semiquantitative RT-PCR technique can be effectively used to putatively identify detoxification gene family and number of genes in each family that may be involved in insecticide resistance.</s><s>The technique is a rapid, sensitive and reproducible screening method to compare expression profiles for hundreds of genes simultaneously, and is comparable to the more complicated, time-consuming and costly DNA microarrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the current study putatively identified five P450 and one esterase genes that were overexpressed in a deltamethrin resistant L. striatellus strain and provided evidence that over-expression of detoxification genes could confer high level insecticide resistance, possibly in the absence of target insensitivity.</s><s>Although our data could not firmly conclude that overexpression of the 6 identified detoxification genes are responsible for the observed high level deltamethrin resistance, it certainly provides a solid foundation for further functional studies of encoded proteins and resistance mechanism confirmation, and for further delineation of cross and/or multiple resistance, which is key for effective resistance management.</s></p></div><figure
