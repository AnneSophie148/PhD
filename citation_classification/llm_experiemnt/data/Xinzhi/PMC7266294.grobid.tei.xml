<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>During the past decade, Drosophila suzukii has established itself as a global invasive fruit pest, enabled by its ability to lay eggs into fresh, ripening fruit.</s><s>In a previous study, we investigated the impact of different strawberry accessions on the development of D. suzukii eggs, in the search of natural resistance.</s><s>We identified several accessions that significantly reduced adult fly emergence from infested fruit.</s><s>In the present study, we aimed at understanding the chemical basis of this effect.</s><s>We first noted that one of the more resistant accessions showed an unusual enrichment of methyl anthranilate within its fruit, prompting us to investigate this fruit compound as a possible cause limiting fly development.</s><s>We found that methyl anthranilate alone triggers embryo lethality in a concentration-dependent manner, unlike another comparable organic fruit compound.</s><s>We also showed that a chemical fraction of the resistant strawberry accession that contains methyl anthranilate carries some activity toward the egg hatching rate.</s><s>Surprisingly, in spite of the lethal effect of this compound to their eggs, adult females are not only attracted to methyl anthranilate at certain concentrations, but they also display a concentration-dependent preference to lay on substrates enriched in methyl anthranilate.</s><s>This study demonstrates that methyl anthranilate is a potent agonist molecule against D. suzukii egg development.</s><s>Its elevated concentration in a specific strawberry accession proven to reduce the fly development may explain, at least in part the fruit resistance.</s><s>It further illustrates how a single, natural compound, non-toxic to humans could be exploited for biological control of a pest species.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methyl anthranilate is toxic to D. suzukii embryos</head><p><s>To directly test a possible involvement of MA into the resistance, we monitored the development of D. suzukii eggs on a substrate containing MA.</s><s>We transferred freshly laid D. suzukii eggs onto an agar-based medium, in the wells of a 12-well cell culture plate (8 eggs/well), containing different amounts of MA.</s><s>To measure embryo survival, we counted the number of hatched embryos in each well every day.</s><s>Under suitable conditions, we expect the vast majority of wild-type D. suzukii eggs to have hatched after 48 hours.</s><s>Our data confirmed this, with a 90% hatching rate in wells devoid of MA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The effect of MA was significant at a concentration of 2.10 -4 (v/v), where 50% of the embryos failed to hatch after 72 hours.</s><s>The toxic effect reached saturation at a concentration of 5.10 -4 .</s><s>Indeed, those embryos that survived had all hatched after 48 h, similar to control groups, with no additional embryos hatching after 72 h.</s><s>We concluded that the reduced number of hatched embryos at 48 hours did not result from delayed embryonic development and that MA is toxic to D. suzukii eggs.</s></p><p><s>Given the fragility of embryonic development, the observed lethality may simply result from the high concentration of an organic compound in the environment.</s><s>To probe the specificity of MA, we repeated the assay with another secondary compound.</s><s>We chose the ester isoamyl acetate, a signature odor of banana <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, also found in a variety of different fruits, including strawberries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Increasing concentrations of isoamyl acetate, however, had no effect on the embryo hatching rate <ref type="bibr">(Fig 2B)</ref>.</s><s>Up to concentrations as high as 10 -3 percent isoamyl acetate, we observed no difference in hatching.</s><s>We concluded that the mere presence of an organic compound, even highly concentrated, was not necessarily toxic to embryos, and inferred that the effect of MA is therefore specific.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narrowing down the active principle of strawberry resistance</head><p><s>The high levels of MA in the resistant accession 300 and its toxicity to fly embryos in an artificial substrate raised the possibility that MA participates to the fruit resistance.</s><s>Therefore, to narrow down the origin of 300 resistance, we proceeded to fractionate its fruits (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and to test the toxicity of the fractions on embryos.</s><s>While we grew 300 plants in our green house, the small population size yielded only low amounts of fruit material, limiting our experiments.</s><s>For a broad separation, we first chose to fractionate the fruits with three solvents.</s><s>We generated a water-soluble fraction (H 2 O), a methanol/water fraction (MetOH/H 2 O) and an ethyl acetate fraction (EtOAc).</s><s>We first measured the MA concentration in fractions of three independent harvests and assessed variability between batches (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; S1 Table ).</s><s>The highest levels of MA were detected in ethyl acetate fractions (1-20 μg/g strawberries), while the MA levels in methanol/water and water fractions were at least an order of magnitude lower (&lt;0.1 μg/g strawberries).</s><s>We used the fractions of an additional batch of fruits to test their activity on D. suzukii embryos in cell culture plates, as described above.</s><s>If MA is the active compound within the fruit (or one of them), we expect to detect an effect on embryo survival that correlates with the amount of MA found in each fraction.</s><s>Preparing medium for our assays in which compounds are at their native fruit concentration proved to be challenging.</s><s>To mitigate a potential loss of activity due to loss or alteration of certain compounds during fractionation, and to account for variation between fruit batches, we decided to concentrate each fraction ten times relative to their native concentrations in the final medium.</s><s>Reasoning that Fragaria vesca fruits contain about 80% water (see methods), we reconstituted each fraction with 8% water, together with agar and the other elements of the medium (see methods).</s><s>We observed a 10% reduction in embryo hatching with the methanol/water fraction as well as with the ethyl acetate fraction, but no reduction, compared to control when exposing the eggs to the water fraction.</s><s>By contrast, similar fractions from commercial (non-resistant) Fragaria ananassae showed no toxicity at all in the same assay (not shown).</s><s>The effect of the 300 ethyl acetate fraction, although modest, compared to the effect measured previously in whole fruits, or the effect of pure MA, could, however, be due to MA itself.</s><s>If this is correct, the similar effect of the methanol/water fraction must result from another compound, as MA levels in this fraction are comparably low to the harmless water fraction (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; S1 Table ).</s><s>These results support the notion that MA may contribute to the embryonic lethality observed in 300 fruits.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. suzukii females preferences to lay on substrates containing methyl anthranilate vary with concentration</head><p><s>With MA having a strong effect on egg hatching, we next wondered how this molecule is perceived by adult female flies.</s><s>We first examined its effect on females in the context of egg-laying.</s><s>Given its toxicity to the eggs, we anticipated that females might avoid laying eggs into a substrate with increased MA levels.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we offered mixed groups of flies within a cage two different egg-laying substrates.</s><s>These substrates consisted of strawberry pure ´e <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that was solidified with agarose and poured into two halves of a Petri dish <ref type="bibr">(Fig 4,</ref><ref type="bibr">schematics)</ref>.</s><s>One half was filled with pure ´e alone, while the other half was filled with the same pure ´e supplemented with MA.</s><s>We tested two MA concentrations, which resulted in contrasted egg-laying preferences (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Females showed a clear aversion to lay on a substrate with a concentration of MA that would kill all their eggs (5.10 -4 ; Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) when offer a choice to lay on plain pure ´e.</s><s>On the other hand, surprisingly, females showed a pronounced preference for pure ´e with a lower MA concentration (2.10 -4 v/v), which kills half of the embryos (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This narrow window of MA concentration which is both attractive to females for egg-laying and toxic to their eggs, raises the possibility that MA could be used for pest control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The valence of volatile methyl anthranilate in D. suzukii is concentrationdependent</head><p><s>Positional preference and egg-laying preference do not always match in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Given the potential interest of MA as a bioactive molecule and the female behavior toward it in the context of egg-laying, we further explored the attraction of adult D. suzukii for MA.</s><s>Specifically, we wondered whether the egg-laying preference might be caused by a general positional preference associated to MA.</s><s>In other words, flies would simply lay more eggs where they spend more time, and this could be conditioned by their attraction to or aversion for MA.</s><s>To evaluate D. suzukii attraction to MA, we used a trap assay in which we offered flies the choice between entering a trap with water or a trap with water and MA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>We found that the fly preference for MA depends on MA concentration.</s><s>The odor presentation differs between the two assays and unlike in the egg-laying assay, flies perceive only plumes of volatile MA in the trap assay.</s><s>The concentrations in the two assays are therefore not comparable.</s><s>A concentration of 2.10 -4 (v/v) results in a significant preference for MA over water alone <ref type="bibr">(Fig 5)</ref>.</s><s>Higher concentrations, however trigger an aversive reaction (strong aversive trend at 4.10 -4 , P-value 0.0517).</s><s>Although the context and MA concentrations cannot be strictly compared, these positional preferences are in line with the egg-laying preferences illustrated in Fig 4.</s></p><p><s>It is therefore difficult to know whether MA concentration in a potential egg-laying substrate directly determines the choice of D. suzukii females, or whether they simply lay eggs where they are, or both.</s><s>The former would likely involve their sense of taste, while the latter could rest exclusively on olfaction.</s><s>We had shown, however, that D. suzukii females carefully chose their egg-laying substrate, using multiple sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>We can at least conclude that females overall prefer to stay and lay their eggs in environments that do not jeopardize their offspring, but that a gray zone may exists where attractive MA is sufficiently concentrated to kill embryos.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we explored a large collection of strawberry accessions for their suitability to Drosophila suzukii larval development.</s><s>We found that fruit size is one significant factor in determining how many adults emerge, with the accession identity being the other.</s></p><p><s>One of these accessions showed an unusual enrichment in MA and led to a significantly reduced emergence of flies.</s><s>In the present study, we tried to elucidate whether MA in the fruits of these plants impacted fly survival.</s><s>We showed that MA alone caused embryo lethality across a wide range of concentrations, and that this effect appears specific, as another comparable fruit compound, isoamyl acetate, was harmless.</s></p><p><s>Attempting to resolve the role of MA in fruits, we undertook a fractionation approach and met the limitations of this approach.</s><s>Although we did find a correlation between the presence of MA and toxicity to the eggs, we faced the difficulty to establish a correspondence between the real MA concentration in a fresh fruit, and the actual concentration in the fractions we tested.</s><s>In spite of these difficulties, we think that fractionation, combined with toxicity tests, is one of the ultimate methods to track down which compounds carries the fruit bioactivity.</s></p><p><s>Our results also suggest a complex and paradoxical ecological relationship between D. suzukii and MA-enriched fruits.</s><s>Females show a preference for substrates with MA at a concentration that is toxic and lethal for their offspring.</s><s>Their preference to lay eggs on such toxic substrates could be explained by their general attraction to volatile MA at certain concentrations.</s><s>This situation is reminiscent of D. sechellia's attraction to lay eggs on Morinda fruits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> whose high concentration of octanoic acid is toxic to the larvae of other species.</s><s>The difference, though, is that D. sechellia larvae are surviving well on these fruits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>While the pressure to utilize novel egg laying substrates is certainly higher in the island dwelling D. sechellia when compared with the now cosmopolitan D. suzukii, it does present another scenario of seemingly contradictory preferences in ovipositioning.</s><s>The simplest hypothesis to resolve this paradox for D. suzukii, then, is that D. suzukii has not been exposed to MAenriched fruits in its native geographic range.</s><s>Therefore the 10-15 years of its worldwide spreading have not been sufficient to select D. suzukii that either dislike and avoid MA, or have become resistant to it.</s></p><p><s>This relationship between the invasive pest D. suzukii and MA might, however, represent an interesting opportunity for the fruit industry.</s><s>Indeed, MA is not toxic to humans, and increasing its concentration on or in fruits that D. suzukii targets could be a pest management strategy.</s><s>In principle, an increase of MA could be achieved by spraying (MA is relatively cheap), through crop selection, or through genetic engineering of specific crops, as the synthesis pathways for MA in fruits are at least partly known <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, if fruits with increased MA concentration proved to be attractive to D. suzukii in the field, including for egg-laying, plants producing such fruits could be used as a sink to deplete local D. suzukii populations.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
