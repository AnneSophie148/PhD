<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Aphids represent one of the major pests in agriculture, and their populations cannot be controlled without the extensive use of insecticides.</s><s>However, their chemical communication systems are exceptionally simple, both with respect to the semiochemicals they use and to the proteins involved in their detection.</s><s>Although aphids comprise a great variety of species, differing in size, shape, colour and host plants, most of them utilize the same alarm pheromone, (E)-ß-farnesene <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, that is released in the presence of danger and induces other individuals of the same as well as of other species to immediately abandon the place.</s><s>The sex pheromones of aphids are mixtures, with relative proportions typical of the species, of nepetalactone and its related alcohols nepetalactols <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Both types of pheromones are not suitable for a wide use in agriculture.</s><s>The synthesis of (E)-ß-farnesene is complex and expensive and the compound is relatively volatile.</s><s>Moreover, its persistence in the environment is also reduced by its ease of oxidation, due to the presence of several double bonds in the molecule.</s><s>It has been shown that in normal conditions of temperature and sunlight about 77% is degraded after 24 hours and only traces are left after 48 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>It is interesting that a number of plants succeed in keeping away aphids by synthesising (E)-ß-farnesene, thus indicating that in principle this compound can be efficiently utilised as aphid repellent <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This fact has suggested the idea of producing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana that is able to synthesise (E)-ß-farnesene and defend itself from aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, thus paving the way for extending such approach to crop plants.</s><s>Sex pheromones, on the other hand, are of little use, not only in population control, but also for monitoring purposes, because aphids reproduce most of the time parthenogenetically.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we have decided to study the aphid chemoreception system at the biochemical level in order to find new strategies for population control.</s><s>In particular we have focused our research on odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), soluble proteins secreted in the lymph of chemosensilla <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, these polypeptides, first regarded as passive carriers for pheromones and odorants, have been recognised as very important elements in the process of chemodetection and recognition.</s><s>Early experments performed with recombinant PBPs of Antheraea polyphemus and Bombyx mori suggested that different pheromone components induced specific conformational changes in different PBPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and that electrophysiological response of sensilla to pheromone components depended on the presence of the correct PBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, evidence has been provided that the presence of OBPs confers higher sensitivity and specificity to the olfactory system of B. mori <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, while LUSH, one of the OBPs of Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be strictly required for perception of the male pheromone vaccenyl acetate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In the same protein, binding of the pheromone induces a conformational change that triggers specific interaction with the corresponding odorant receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>This has been very elegantly demonstrated by showing that a mutant of LUSH, mimicking the conformation of the protein when bound to vacceny acetate, efficiently activates the olfactory receptor, even in the absence of the pheromone.</s><s>At the behavioural level, exchange of two genes encoding OBPs in two species of Drosophila produces, to some extent, switching of behaviour towards some fatty acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, a very recent work analysed the response to several odorant of 17 strains of Drosophila, each deficient in one specific OBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The results clearly show that in each strain the olfactory response was modified in different specific way, in some cases finely tuned to one or two odorants.</s><s>These fundamental papers not only provide strong evidence that OBPs are involved in odour discrimination, but also indicate that a combinatorial code is utilised by insects to recognise olfactory stimuli.</s><s>Moreover, they shift the focus from olfactory receptors to OBPs as the proteins responsible for decoding the chemical information carried by odorants and pheromones, and the best target for interfering with the insect's olfactory system.</s></p><p><s>Further support to the key role of OBPs in odour discrimination has been provided in two species of mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus, where silencing genes for OBPs selectively abolishes response to indole <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>We can therefore confidently attempt to relate the binding specificities of OBPs in a given species with behavioural responses.</s></p><p><s>The genome sequencing of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum has revealed the presence of 15 genes encoding OBPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In a first investigation limited to three OBPs, we have found that (E)-ßfarnesene and related compounds bind specifically to only OBP3, suggesting not only that this protein might be involved in the recognition of the alarm pheromone, but also that activation of other OBPs could produce a response pattern that is no longer recognised as an alarm signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We have also synthesised new insecticides combining classical aphicidal moieties with a terpene region mimicking (E)-ßfarnesene.</s><s>Such compounds retain insecticidal activity, as well as specific binding to OBP3, suggesting that they might be also endowed with repellent properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here we describe the bacterial expression and characterization of three additional OBPs of aphids.</s><s>We have also measured the binding properties of 29 pure chemicals with six recombinant OBPs and their repellent activity in two species of aphids.</s><s>On the basis of the results obtained, we suggest that OBP3 and OBP7 are the proteins responsible for mediating the perception of the alarm pheromone (E)-ß-farnesene and of other repellents, and provide guidelines for the discovery and design of new aphid repellents.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In our previous paper we had suggested that OBP3 could be involved in the perception of (E)-ß-farnesene.</s><s>The novel concept that we had proposed was that recognition of the alarm pheromone could be based not on a particularly high affinity of this compound for OBP3, but rather on the specific binding to only such OBP among the three tested in that report <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In this work we support this model with behavioural experimental evidence and include a second protein (OBP7) that could mediate perception of the alarm pheromone.</s><s>OBP7 is very similar to OBP3, but only limited to their binding pockets, while identity between the two proteins is not more than 11%.</s><s>Most important, however, the behaviour data reported for two species of aphids, indicate a consistency between repellency and binding characteristics.</s><s>Based on these six OBPs, that are representative of the small aphids repertoire of these polypeptides, we can propose a model that allows us to predict, with reasonable confidence, whether a new chemical compound could be a repellent (for aphids that use (E)-ß-farnesene as the alarm pheromone), based on binding experiments.</s><s>In particular, we have shown that repellency correlates well with exclusive affinity to OBP3 or OBP7 or both.</s><s>A measurable affinity to other OBPs could significantly modify the olfactory map produced in the antennal lobes to impair recognition of the stimulus as similar to (E)-ß-farnesene.</s></p><p><s>The idea that each olfactory stimulus generates a complex map at the level of antennal lobes and that the map is recognised by the brain, rather than its components, is certainly not new, both in insects and in vertebrates.</s><s>Each glomerulus receives the signals from each type of olfactory receptors and the map in the antennal lobe is basically a processed version of the map generated at the periferal level by olfactory receptors.</s><s>Now, in the light of the new specific role of OBPs in olfactory perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and based on the results here presented, we can identify a level, between odorants and olfactory receptors, where decodification of the chemical message is performed by OBPs.</s></p><p><s>However, our model is a crude simplification of the more complex biological system.</s><s>The correlation between binding data and behaviour, that we have presented in this work, although statistically significant, is not perfect.</s><s>The occurrence of few exceptions to the rule we propose can be related to several factors.</s><s>First, other OBPs, among those we have not examined, or also CSPs or other still unknown binding proteins, could be involved in building the olfactory image of (E)-ß-farnesene and other repellents.</s><s>Second, our criterion of considering as ligands only those compounds that could displace 50% of the bound 1-NPN at a concentration lower than 20 mM could be rather arbitrary and affect to some extent the classification of a compound as ''ligand''.</s><s>Finally, we should be aware that binding activity, as measured ''in vitro'' does not faithfully reproduce the ''in vivo'' conditions, particularly in terms of protein concentration.</s><s>Given the above limitations and caveats, however, our data provide for the first time a good correlation between behavioural effects and binding properties of odorants and further support the recent view that OBPs in insects are responsible for recognising the different semiochemicals.</s><s>Moreover, they can provide indications and guidelines for designing and screening new repellents for aphids.</s><s>In fact, potential repellents could be first tested in simple and rapid binding experiments with the six OBPs, and then only those binding OBP3 and/or OBP7 could be further screened in more expensive and time-consumeing behaviour experiments.</s><s>Similar approaches could also be devised to tackle analogous problems in other insect species.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 3.</s><s>Chemical structures of the general odorants used in binding experiments.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032759.g003</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,58.05,543.97,466.88,160.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>
