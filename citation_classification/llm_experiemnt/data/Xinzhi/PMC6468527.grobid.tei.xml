<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bt Strain-Derived Toxins with Activity against Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP)</head><p><s>To identify Bt strain-derived toxins that have toxicity against ACP, toxin mixtures derived from each of 18 Bt strains and two recombinant Bt Cry toxins were screened in ACP bioassays using toxin preparations that had been solubilized and trypsin activated to expose ACP to activated toxins (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Of the 18 Bt isolates tested, six strains expressed toxins that were toxic to ACP, the two recombinant Cry toxins -Cry4A and Cry11A were not toxic, and 12 strains lacked toxicity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For the six isolates with significant ACP mortality compared to control treatments, a toxin dose of 500 Âµg/mL resulted in mortality at day 7 ranging from 50% to 100%.</s><s>Mortality induced by toxins derived from each Bt strain (normalized with the control mortality) at day 7 was: IBL-68, 70%; IBL-365, 60%; IBL-681, 50%; IBL-200, 45%; IBL-48, 40%; IBL-829, 30%.</s><s>The estimated probability of mortality at day 7 showed significantly increased probability for these six treatments compared to the control by logistic regression analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Toxicity Correlated with Reduced Feeding</head><p><s>The intoxication effects of Cry toxins include disruption of the midgut epithelium resulting in gut paralysis, cessation of feeding, starvation and eventual death <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Excretions produced as psyllids feed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> were monitored as an indicator of feeding cessation.</s><s>Based on this assay, adult ACP stopped feeding on some Bt strains (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, ACP fed on toxins derived from strains IBL-00068, -00200, and -00829 at a dose of 500 Âµg/mL produced significantly fewer excretions compared to the buffer control diet after 7 days of exposure (Dunn's test; p &lt; 0.05.</s><s>All insects in the IBL-00365 bioassay were dead by day 7 such that data for this strain could not be included in the analysis).</s><s>This result suggests that mortality recorded in these assays resulted from cessation of feeding induced by the action of Cry toxins.</s></p></div>
