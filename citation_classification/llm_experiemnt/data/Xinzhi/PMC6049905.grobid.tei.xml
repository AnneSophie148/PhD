not consider penetration and withdrawal as different waveforms, as we considered both activities as part of waveform C.</s></p><p><s>Waveform Xc indicates the first contact with a xylem vessel and could represent a preingestion or trial ingestion (term previously proposed by Crane <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> for Graphocephala atropunctata Signoret (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) (previously Hordnia circellata)).</s><s>The images produced by micro-CT indicate that during this waveform the stylets are within a xylem vessel.</s><s>Xc waveform is characterized by a high frequency sinusoidal shape, in contrast with the alternation of peaks and plateaus that occurs during waveform Xi.</s><s>During Xc, no excretion was observed and we have no conclusive evidence about the biological meaning of this waveform.</s><s>Besides the high similarity of Xc with that described by Miranda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, this pattern also resembles the C1 waveform, representing the last waveform in pathway phase described for G. atropunctata and Homalodisca vitripennis Germar (1821) (previously H. coagulata) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) using an AC-EPG system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>.</s><s>In the latter work, C1 was sometimes correlated with xylem contact.</s><s>We suggest, consistently with Miranda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> that Xc represents an activity in response to mechanical or chemical stimuli resulting from the contact with a xylem vessel.</s><s>During Xc, once reached the xylem, the insect could taste the sap by means of the pre-cibarial sensilla <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> without swallowing it, and initiates cibarial pump activity to balance the vessel tension in order to later begin the proper feeding (active xylem sap ingestion).</s><s>However, this hypothesis should be further tested in order to definitely determine the biological meaning of waveform Xc.</s></p><p><s>Waveform Xi corresponds to active xylem sap ingestion, as proven by occurrence of excretion in adults and excretion/secretion in nymphs only during this EPG pattern.</s><s>The production of the first excretory droplets was delayed in respect to the beginning of the Xi waveform (two to 10 min).</s><s>Likely, the delay could be associated with the fact that excretion by P. spumarius requires previous accumulation of xylem sap in the gut to process, as further proven by the absence of excretion at Xi frequency as low as 0.1-0.2</s><s>Hz, thus in correspondence to a likely slow and reduced sap intake.</s><s>The amount of excreta produced by P. spumarius during our observations (6.94 drops/min for females, 3.57 for males) is consistent with the data reported by Malone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> (ca. 1 drop every 10-11 sec), and far lower than values described for sharpshooters such as B. xanthophis (ca.</s><s>24 drops/min, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>), and G. atropunctata (ca.</s><s>1drop/ sec <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, although only indirectly, we hypothesize that P. spumarius has a lower ingestion rate than sharpshooters.</s><s>Furthermore, through the delicate nymphal cuticle, we also observed the movements of cibarial muscles and diaphragm, correlating each rhythmic movement to the Xi waveform pattern (S1 Video).</s><s>According to our video recordings, we can propose that each peak that composes Xi corresponds to muscle contraction and diaphragm lift that create the required tension for sap aspiration, while each plateau corresponds to muscle relaxation and diaphragm collapse, which lead to sap swallowing.</s><s>A similar correlation was described for H. vitripennis with the flow of Chinese ink particles suspended in artificial diet observed moving inward/outward the stylet <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>P. spumarius is rapid in reaching the xylem and initiating sap ingestion (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>), with first Xc and Xi occurring 8.74 and 13.41 minutes after the onset of the

meadow spittlebug has been reported as a vector of the Elm yellow phytoplasma, and the latter organism only colonizes the phloem <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>, in certain conditions and on certain hosts, the insect might divert its behavior from xylem to phloem feeding.</s><s>For example, significant changes in feeding behavior have been related to plant susceptibility/ resistance in Nephotettix virescens Distant (1908) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), a phloem feeder that tends to feed more often from xylem in resistant rice varieties <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Our EPG recordings were restricted to the first 8 hours, thus any further feeding activities happening after that time were not recorded.</s><s>Nevertheless, prior to start the feeding behavior characterization study described in this paper, we performed two comparative 24-hours EPG recordings, one with two males, the other with two females (data not shown).</s><s>Briefly, two individuals of the same sex were tethered and connected to the EPG as described above.</s><s>The electric circuit was closed only for one of the insect, while the other was not subjected to electric current, since the plant electrode was not connected to the potting media.</s><s>After the 24 hours EPG, each individual was caged singly on a vetch plant, transferred to a growth chamber at 25˚C, 80% HR, and monitored at intervals of eight hours for three days.</s><s>Either the two males or the two females, whether subjected or not to EPG electric current, were found to be alive and active at the end of the three days monitoring periods.</s><s>Furthermore, neither phloem-related waveforms nor waveforms other than those described for the eight hour recordings were observed.</s></p><p><s>Throughout the recording, periods of sustained xylem ingestion (Xi) were interspersed with periods of resting, defined by waveform R, also present in the last 2 hours of recording (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>During this waveform we observed no activities, neither fluid excretion nor movements, while the stylets remained within the xylem (Fig 2 : 7 and 8); the same resting behavior for the meadow spittlebug has been described by Malone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The slight gradual voltage increase occurring during waveform R could be associated with a tiny partial withdrawal of stylets, as observed also by Joost et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Voltage variation during R, with occasional drops and spikelet bursts, may be associated with stylet movements within the same sheath, before restarting sustained ingestion, as well as other activities or tentative ingestion.</s><s>Therefore, while Miranda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> suggested that this R waveform was a resting behavior occurring in the parenchyma before reaching any vascular tissues, we propose that R represents a resting phase during the xylem ingestion period, required by P. spumarius after spending a great amount of energy in loading the cibarial pump during the xylem ingestion phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, waveform N, consistently with Miranda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, represents an interruption during xylem phase, occurring either during Xc or Xi; drops similar to N, that we did not consider in the analysis and deserve further dedicated investigation, were also sometimes observed during resting R (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3: h</ref>).</s><s>Through micro-tomography, we assessed that during this specific waveform the stylet tips are located within the xylem.</s><s>Therefore, if N is an activity performed in a xylem vessel, the initial drop (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3:</ref> f) should not be associated with a potential drop related to an stylet puncture of a living cell (transmembrane potential) as reported for stylet cell punctures made by aphids, but could be more likely generated by streaming potentials derived from valve movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>These valve movements could represent extravasation or egestion of fluids from the cibarium/pre-cibarium to the food canal and then to the plant tissues, but further investigation is needed to test this hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, N could even represent an interruption in xylem phase and the successive switch to another xylem vessel, as suggested by Backus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> and Miranda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Further research is also needed in order to characterize the biological meaning of the different sub-phases of the N waveform (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3:</ref> f and h), looking for a possible correlation with waveforms

spumarius feeding on olive were the time required to begin xylem ingestion, and the duration of xylem ingestion.</s><s>Males require longer time for the onset of xylem ingestion after alighting on the plant, while this difference was not statistically significant once the time to the first Xi was calculated from the beginning of the probe.</s><s>One of the explanations underlying the observed difference could be the greater sensitivity of males to manipulation, with longer recovering times after tethering.</s><s>Regarding the duration of Xi, P. spumarius females ingest longer than males, as also confirmed by the greater amount of excreta produced by the former.</s><s>Overall, females spend ingesting (Xi waveform) the 72.7% of the probing time, consistently with data produced on grape

<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> for H. vitripennis, transmission efficiency of X. fastidiosa is independent from the sex of the vector.</s><s>Therefore, the fact that the main difference in feeding behavior between male and female is the duration of the ingestion phase, suggests that bacterial transmission could be driven by a mechanism dissociated from the time spent in xylem
