<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Chemical pesticides have been used to control insect pests since the 1940s; however, their adverse effects on nontarget organisms, residues on food crops and groundwater, and development of insect resistance to chemicals have forced scientists to develop alternative ecofriendly measures such as biocontrol, the exploitation of living agents to combat harmful organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>Biocontrol agents are an important component of a sustainable pest management program because effective agents can be chosen to persist in the environment with low ecological impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Entomopathogenic fungi have been widely used to control agricultural, grassland, medical, and veterinary insect pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</s><s>Species of Metarhizium (Clavicipitaceae: Hypocreales) can infect more than 200 species of arthropods in over 50 families <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>They produce spores (conidia) that can germinate on the surface of the insect, penetrate its cuticle, and grow inside the insect.</s><s>Then, they produce toxins, which presumably aid in suppressing host immune defenses, eventually killing the host, and fending off potential microbial competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</s><s>After death of the host, the fungus will grow out of the integument and produce aerial conidia, which are disseminated into the environment and may infect more insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Pesticides developed from species of Metarhizium remain active for a long period, are not harmful to the environment and nontarget organisms, but they can take a long time to kill the insect, are unstable, and their control efficacy is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mycoviruses have been discovered in a wide range of fungal species, and some are usually associated with symptomless infections or with reduced growth rate or virulence to higher organisms of the pathogenic fungus <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>This reduction in virulence led to the idea that mycoviruses can serve as a biocontrol measure against fungal pathogens as in the case of chestnut blight caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica in North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>Some pathogenic fungi can live as a beneficial or nonpathogenic endophyte when infected with a mycovirus as do Sclerotinia sclerotiorum or Pestalotiopsis theae <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s><s>Few known mycoviruses, however, promote fungal growth and are associated with a hypervirulent or other extreme phenotypes.</s><s>The presence of a viral 6.0-kbp dsRNA in Nectria radicicola, the fungus that causes ginseng nectria root rot, was found to be associated with high levels of virulence, sporulation, laccase activity, and pigmentation in this fungus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>A newly discovered example is a novel ambigrammatic mycovirus that enhances the virulence of Puccinia striiformis f. sp.</s><s>tritici, which causes wheat stripe rust <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Many mycoviruses have also been discovered in entomopathogenic fungi.</s><s>About 21.3% of a worldwide collection of isolates of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana were found to harbor various mycoviruses and other dsRNA elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Some of the isolates infected with polymycoviruses were found to be mildly hypervirulent against the greater wax moth (G.</s><s>mellonella).</s><s>There is also evidence that species of Metarhizium harbor large numbers of mycoviruses, which generally reduce mycelial growth, conidial production, and virulence of the host fungus by affecting its ability to tolerate heat and UV-B radiation and to penetrate insect cuticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>.</s><s>However, information on mycoviruses in entomopathogenic fungi and their effects on the host phenotype remains limited.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we isolated and characterized a novel mycovirus Metarhizium flavoviride partitivirus 1 (MfPV1) from M. flavoviride isolated from small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus), an important insect vector for several plant viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</s><s>When we used MfPV1 to transfect virus-free commercial strains of two other Metarhizium species, conidiation and virulence of the transfected isolates were enhanced.</s><s>This study reports a mycovirus in an entomopathogenic fungus that can endow significant hypervirulence to other fungi and opens the possibility that mycoviruses can elevate the activity of biocontrol agents.</s></p></div>
