<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Citrus species represent a globally significant agricultural commodity, with annual production &gt; 140 million tons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, thereby establishing a substantial source of income.</s><s>In Greece, citriculture, with more than 19 million trees predominantly located in the southern and northwestern parts of the country (mainly in Crete and Peloponnese), is one of the three most important fruit crops, highlighting its immense social-economic importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>However, citriculture is threatened by the occurrence of pests and vectorborne viral diseases, which can compromise the final product quality and increase input requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, accurate identification of pests and their dynamics, as well as their potential to serve as vectors for diseases, are necessary to sustain healthy crops and to develop control strategies.</s></p><p><s>Aphids typically appear during the citrus growing season from late spring to early summer and late summer to early autumn, coinciding with periods of tender flush growth.</s><s>Aphids can cause both direct damage, such as leaf deformation, and indirect damage, like the development of sooty molds in honeydew secretions, and predominantly transmit viral pathogens on citrus trees, like citrus tristeza virus (CTV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>While all aphid species can acquire and transmit the CTV in a semi-persistent manner, their efficacy varies depending on the aphid species and the virus strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Aphis citricidus (Kirkaldy), or brown citrus aphid, is considered one of the most damaging aphid species affecting citrus plants worldwide and the most important vector of CTV due to its high transmission efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>A. gossypii (Glover), the cotton aphid, is also an efficient CTV vector in California, Israel, and Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, while Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) and A. spiraecola Patch are considered less efficient vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Besides flush cycles affecting CTV transmissibility by the viruliferous aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, the aphid population dynamics play a pivotal role in CTV transmissibility, which can vary even among similar orchards in a specific area.</s><s>The factors that primarily determine the population dynamics of aphids are related to environmental parameters such as abiotic factors, host plant vigorousness, and aphid migration limitations.</s><s>To date, previous studies in Greece have identified nine species of aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> without any record of A. citricidus.</s></p><p><s>CTV is a typical member of the genus Closterovirus (family Closteroviridae) with a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 19.3 kb consisting of 12 open reading frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>CTV naturally infects citrus and other related genera, causing one of the most destructive citrus diseases worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Depending on the virus genotype and the scion-rootstock combination, CTV appears in three syndromes with variable severity and symptomatology: quick decline, stem pitting, and seedling yellows <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, 11 distinct CTV genotypes have been identified based on whole genome sequences, which can exist individually or in combination as a complex within a citrus plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The introduction of CTV in new areas occurs through plant material exchange and aphid vectors, both of which have contributed to the vast expansion of CTV <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In Greece, various citrus viruses and viroids have been recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and 20 years after the initial report of CTV in oranges in Crete and Peloponnese <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, it is still considered a quarantine pathogen that has gradually become endemic in various areas, along with the invasion of new hosts <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Three CTV genotypes have been detected so far in Greece: the severe VT genotype, restricted in northern areas, and the T30 (mild) and RB (severe) genotypes in Crete <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the identity of aphid species serving as local vectors for CTV transmission in Greece remains to be elucidated.</s></p><p><s>Identifying aphid species morphologically using a stereoscope has certain practical disadvantages.</s><s>The process is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, as distinguishing features require examination of high magnification of specimens of alate and apterous adult aphids, which sometimes can be damaged through sample preparation.</s></p><p><s>Molecular identification requires a different type of expertise and equipment.</s><s>The need for high-quality equipment and skilled personnel further limits accessibility, making the method less efficient for large-scale monitoring or rapid diagnostics.</s><s>Because of these practical difficulties, new optical methods for monitoring insect species that utilize advanced light modulation and reflection techniques to capture unique wingbeat patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> can be considered an optional method for aerial-borne insects like alate aphids.</s><s>By analyzing these optical signatures, these systems offer non-invasive, real-time identification of insects in flight, aiding in environmental monitoring, pest control, and biodiversity research.</s><s>Optical approaches, as applied to the open field or embedded in insect traps, enhance accuracy and automation in insect counting and identification.</s><s>The captured optical signal stemming from a flying insect contains the wingbeat frequency and other characteristics, such as the amplitudes of the harmonics that can be shown to be characteristic of a specific species.</s><s>The size and morphology of the insect, the way its flight-related muscles move the wings, and the frequency that beats its wing are a kind of biometric parameters.</s><s>Despite the limitation of not being as accurate as morphological identification with keys or molecular identification, insect species recognition based on wingbeat patterns offers several advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>It can be non-invasive, allowing for the monitoring of insect populations without capturing or disturbing them.</s><s>It does not require the termination of the insect specimen.</s><s>It is relatively inexpensive and can be embeddable in insect traps so that insects are classified by artificial intelligence programs almost instantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>It can also be deployed in remote or hard-to-reach locations to give proxies for the captured population.</s><s>When optical means based on backscattered light from insects form arrays large enough to become stand-alone stations, they can give a rough distribution of flying insect fauna with sufficient classification accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recent observations from multiannual monitoring of CTV in Crete at our laboratory suggest that a natural virus spread is occurring, necessitating detailed studies.</s><s>The present work aims to determine the aphid population distribution in citrus orchards and species composition and identify prevalent aphid species as CTV vectors.</s><s>This information is critical for developing optical devices capable of clearly detecting specific aphids in flight and registering their wingbeat for surveillance and monitoring, allowing automated quantification of the risk to a crop.</s><s>These results enrich our knowledge of aphid dynamics and identification of putative viruliferous vectors, facilitating the development of sustainable approaches for the control of both aphids and CTV.</s></p></div>
