bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso), the putative causal agent of zebra chip disease of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.).</s><s>Zebra chip has caused millions of dollars in losses to the potato industry in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>This phloem-limited plant pathogen also severely damages other economically important solanaceous crops, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), and tamarillo (Solanum betaceum L.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The potato psyllid is believed to be a native of southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and its current geographic distribution in the New World is limited to western United States and Canada, Mexico, and Central America <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Bactericera cockerelli was accidentally introduced in New Zealand, where it was first documented in 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Zebra chip was shown to be associated with the potato psyllid in 2006 by Munyaneza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, preceding the discovery of Lso in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Following the discovery of Lso economically affecting potato and other solanaceous crops in the Americas and New Zealand, Lso was documented for the first time in Europe in carrot (Daucus carota L.) crops and in the carrot psyllid Trioza apicalis (= Dyspersa apicalis) Förster, from plant and insect samples collected in Finland <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The bacterium was then reported in carrot and T. apicalis in several other European countries, including Norway, Sweden, and Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Subsequently, Lso was detected in carrot and celery (Apium graveolens L.) crops and in the psyllid Bactericera trigonica Hodkinson in several countries within the Mediterranean region, including Spain, the Canary Islands, and France <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Most recently, Lso was reported for the first time on the African continent, in carrot crops in Morocco <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Damage to carrots by Lso-infected psyllids in Europe and northern Africa can cause up to 100% crop loss <ref type="bibr">[2, 10-11, 20, 22]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, Lso was recently shown to be transmitted through carrot seeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While several psyllid species in Europe are known to have carrot as a host plant, no psyllids in the Americas or New Zealand have been documented to have this plant species as a host.</s><s>Potato psyllid, a known host of Lso, is not present in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, five geographic haplotypes of Lso have so far been described, including two (A and B) that are associated with solanaceous species and potato psyllids <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and three (C, D, and E) that are associated with carrot and celery crops and carrot psyllids <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>The five Lso haplotypes are not yet known to elicit biological differences in the plant or insect hosts and their apparent stability suggests separate long-lasting populations of the bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is not known whether Lso haplotypes associated with solanaceous species can successfully infect and induce disease symptoms in Apiaceae and vice-versa.</s></p><p><s>Several studies have demonstrated transmission of Lso by B. cockerelli to potato and other solanaceous species <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr"

potato psyllid or to potato by carrot psyllids, or whether cross-transmission could actually lead to successful development of symptoms characteristic of the bacterium infection in either crop.</s><s>This is particularly important, given the potential risk of Lso infection and spread between solanaceous and Apiaceae crops that might be growing in close proximity.</s><s>Thus, the objectives of the present study were to: 1) assess whether potato psyllid can transmit Lso to carrot under controlled laboratory and field conditions, 2) assess whether Lso haplotypes infecting solanaceous species can also infect carrot and induce characteristic disease symptoms, and 3) assess stylet probing behavior of potato psyllid on carrot with electropenetrography (EPG) technology to further elucidate potential Lso transmission to Apiaceae by this potato insect pest.</s></p></div>
