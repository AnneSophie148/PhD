<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNAi-mediated knockdown of Pmtra-2</head><p><s>Since Pmtra-2 is expressed across all developmental stages (Fig 2 ), we balanced the ease of injection with likelihood of phenotypic change <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by injecting Pmtra-2 dsRNA into 3 rd -instar nymphs.</s><s>Injectees were reared to adulthood, and external phenotypic changes in their reproductive state were assessed.</s><s>Female injectees had deformed ovipositors that resembled male claspers, while males displayed no overt difference in their appearance (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>It should be noted that injection of EGFP dsRNA did not impact P. maidis adult phenotypes.</s><s>We further tested the fertility of male injectees by crossing each male to three young virgin wild-type females.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Pmtra-2-dsRNA-injected males produced almost no offspring, indicating that RNAi-mediated knockdown of Pmtra-2 has a negative effect on male fertility.</s><s>Importantly, the results were similar to those found in RNAi silencing of tra-2 in N. lugens <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRISPR-mediated knockout of Pmtra-2</head><p><s>Screening for successful CRISPR/Cas9 editing events in the absence of a selectable marker can be like searching for a needle in a haystack.</s><s>Therefore, given the sizeable amount of space, plants and personnel that would be needed to screen G 1 progeny for individuals possessing a tra-2 knockout allele, we opted to look at the impact of tra-2 knockout in G 0 injectees.</s><s>Of the 925 embryos injected with Cas9 complexed with gRNAs targeting Pmtra-2, less than a third (259) showed signs of embryonic development.</s><s>Of the 59 that hatched, only 30 survived to adulthood.</s><s>Of these, only two adult females (09F and 11F) possessed deformed ovipositors (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Since sterility is the key to pgSIT, we conducted mating assays to determine if fertility was impacted in any of the injectees.</s><s>After giving injectees sufficient time to mate, we isolated their genomic DNA, amplified and sequenced the target region, and submitted the resulting sequence data for Synthego ICE analysis.</s><s>The goal was to determine if changes in fertility were correlated with the levels of CRISPR-based genome editing.</s><s>It should be noted that only injectees that survived until the end of the mating assay and who had at least two surviving mates are reported here (thus only 11).</s><s>Interestingly, while the two females having deformed ovipositors (09F and 11F) failed to produce offspring (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), ICE analysis detected little to no signs of genome editing.</s><s>Specifically, no edited sequence was detected within the amplification products obtained from female 09F, and only two percent of the amplification products from female 11F possessed the 43-bp deletion (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>What was even more surprising than the extremely small percentage of genotypic change in the two females was the high levels of</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The number of tra-2 transcripts varies between insects.</s><s>For example, there are six known tra-2 transcripts in Bombyx mori <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Apis mellifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, three in Tribolium castaneum <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Table 1.</s><s>The survival of dsRNA-injected nymphs and effect of knockdown on male fertility.</s><s>Total number of injected nymphs Nymphs reaching adulthood Average number of offspring per male Males Females EGFP dsRNA 34 9 7 77.4 (n = 11) 56 2 6 65 6 8 Pmtra-2 dsRNA 48 6 0 0.3 (n = 15) 55 7 1 65 3 2 <ref type="url"

in Bactrocera dorsalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Diaphorina citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Given the relatively close relationship between P. maidis and N. lugens, it is not surprising that the same number of tra-2 transcripts was identified in both planthopper species.</s><s>While the two Nltra-2 transcripts only differ at the 5' end, the P. maidis transcripts differ at the 5' end as well as in the sequence connecting the RS1 and RRM regions.</s><s>Microinjecting early-stage nymphs is challenging but based on the data from Zhuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> microinjecting Nltra-2 dsRNA later in development resulted in weaker phenotypic changes.</s><s>Therefore, we settled on delivering dsRNA to 3 rd -instar nymphs, since individuals at this stage are large enough to handle, yet young enough to expect significant masculinization of females to occur.</s><s>Indeed, our results were similar to those found in N. lugens <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Such results, masculinization of females due to tra-2 knockdown, have been reported in a number of insects including Musca domestica <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Ceratitis capitata <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Anastrepha obliqua <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>There are differences though.</s><s>In N. lugens, researchers also noticed a change in body size.</s><s>Specifically, knockdown of Nltra-2 resulted in smaller females and bigger males.</s><s>However, this was not noted in other insects.</s><s>We found that there were smaller females and bigger males, but these appeared to be individual differences, not the result of Pmtra-2 knockdown.</s></p><p><s>To further evaluate the potential of tra-2 as a target for pgSIT in hemipterans, we generated tra-2 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.</s><s>We used two gRNAs, one designed to target the conserved RS2 domain and the second targeting the linker sequence (Fig 1A ), to maximize the chances of generating mutants by deleting the intervening sequence between the two cut sites.</s><s>This also should have increased efficiency by compensating for the possibility that either gRNA might be ineffective.</s><s>However, a deletion in this region could lead to a frameshift that would result in a new amino acid sequence at the 3' end, and this could have a dominant negative effect on fitness.</s><s>While female 09F and 11F had little to no signs of genome editing based on ICE analysis, they possessed deformed ovipositors.</s><s>This suggests that in these individuals, tra-2 may have only been knocked out in a small subset of tissues, thereby causing the level of edited sequences in female 09F to be too low for ICE analysis, but that small subset of tissues included the super important tissues involved in the development of the ovipositor.</s><s>In comparison, female 1028F and 1031F had high levels of edited sequences but normal ovipositors likely because the genome-edited cells were not in the tissues that gave rise to their ovipositors.</s><s>Taken together, the results suggest that where the genome-edited cells are located matters, which of course is not surprising.</s></p><p><s>CRISPR-mediated knockout of Pmtra-2 impacted both male and female fertility, which is desirable for pgSIT, particularly male infertility.</s><s>While mosaic knockout resulted in males producing fewer offspring, we were unable to determine the levels of genome editing in some injectees (1031M, 1105M and 1112M) due to sequence quality being too low for ICE analysis.</s><s>It is possible that a highly heterogeneous mix of indels was created in these individuals, hence the low sequence quality.</s><s>Another issue is that though a significant proportion of edited sequences was detected in male 1025M (only 16% wild type), it still produced offspring.</s><s>While PCR amplification bias could be an explanation for the high levels of edited sequences, it is also possible that the genome-edited cells simply were not in its reproductive tissues.</s><s>Either way, the lack of a complete tra-2 knockout is problematic since we cannot be 100% sure that loss of Tra-2 function will result in sterile males, which is an absolute necessity for pgSIT.</s></p><p><s>We could not generate a complete tra-2 knockout most likely due to lethality caused by loss of Tra-2 function during late-stage embryogenesis.</s><s>Interestingly, similar finding was reported in A. mellifera.</s><s>Namely, in honeybees injection of tra-2 dsRNA into early-stage embryos resulted in death *70 hours post injection, which is also around the late embryonic stage <ref type="bibr"

timing of CRISPR-mediated tra-2 knockout needs to be tightly controlled to avoid the lethal effects in the late embryonic stage if tra-2 is to be used as a target for pgSIT.</s></p><p><s>Since our assay could not fully address questions regarding the outcome of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of tra-2 due to only testing mosaic G 0 injectees, future work will focus on knockout of tra-2 and simultaneously knockin of a dominant marker gene such as DsRed.</s><s>This would enable an easier screen since only the relatively rare G 1 individuals expressing the fluorescent marker would need to be tested.</s><s>Given limited resources (corn plants, space and personnel), it was not feasible to carry out a large-scale screen in the absence of a mechanism for detecting which G 1 offspring should be tested via the rather time intensive crossing scheme.</s><s>Importantly, the proposed screen would also allow us to test our hypothesis that knockout of tra-2 is homozygous lethal.</s></p><p><s>As mentioned above, pgSIT requires two homozygous strains, one expressing Cas9 nuclease and the other expressing gRNAs targeting genes such as those involved in fertility.</s><s>We currently have P. maidis strains that express Cas9 (Klobasa et al., paper in preparation).</s><s>However, since Cas9 is driven by a ubiquitin-like promoter, which drives constitutive expression, crossing these strains with a Pmtra-2-gRNA-expressing strain would likely kill all the offspring during the late embryonic stage.</s><s>Therefore, to build a functional system, we plan to restrict Cas9 expression to later stages of development, or to limit expression to specific tissues, such as the gonads, by using age/tissue-specific promoters.</s><s>We are also in the process of creating a P. maidis strain expressing Pmtra-2 gRNAs.</s><s>Given the desirable phenotypic changes observed in Pmtra-2-dsRNA-injected insects, an RNAi-based method of SIT could perhaps be used to control this hemipteran species <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>PLOS ONE</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p><s>value
