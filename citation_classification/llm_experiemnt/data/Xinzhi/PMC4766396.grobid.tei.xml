<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here we have demonstrated that the microbiome of larval Culex mosquitoes changes throughout development, and variation between instars is affected when exposed to various PPCPs.</s><s>It has previously been demonstrated that mosquitoes rely on their microbiomes to aid in development and that removing certain symbionts can significantly slow larval development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Pennington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> demonstrated that PPCPs at environmentally relevant concentrations, which are significantly lower than those used in most laboratory studies, can alter the microbiome of mosquitoes and slow their development.</s></p><p><s>In the field, Duguma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> showed pooled Culex species' microbiomes will change from early (first and second) to late (third and fourth) instars.</s><s>Coon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> showed that the microbiome of mosquitoes will change as the insects advance from fourth instar larvae, to pupae, to the adult stage, and after adults fed on a blood meal.</s><s>We have shown that the microbiome of early (second and third) instars' will change from one instar to the next even without exposure to PPCPs (control group).</s><s>In the second, third, and fourth instars, predominant families change from Cytophagaceae to Enterobacteriaceae and finally to Microbacteriaceae.</s><s>However similar to Pennington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , third and fourth instar were not significantly different and our findings also correlate to what Duguma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> found in their laboratory reared Culex tarsalis late instars.</s><s>However, as their third and fourth instars were pooled, only the Enterobacteriaceae family predominates.</s><s>These families were all removed in the  antibiotic and mixture treatments.</s><s>Fourth instar larvae in the control group match what was described in Aedes aegypti by Coon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Coon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> also described the microbiome of two other mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae and Georgecraigius atropalpus) during the fourth instar.</s><s>Their microbiomes had different proportions of familial microbiota between each other and both were different from the findings in our C. quinquefasciatus fourth instars.</s><s>To our knowledge ours is the first study to look at the microbiome changes of individual early instars in mosquitoes.</s><s>This suggests the possibility of a new strategy for mosquito control targeting the critical microorganisms essential for development at specific stages.</s><s>Specifically, additional research targeting key symbionts found in earlier instars would determine if the younger larvae can be controlled more effectively, as has been seen with pesticides such as Bti <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>A number of mosquitoes are common carriers of the bacterial genus Wolbachia, which usually acts as a reproductive parasite in the ovaries of the females, and is suspected to be in at least 20% of all insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>As in Pennington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , Rickettsiaceae, the family containing Wolbachia pipientis, continuously holds the majority count of the antibiotic and mixture treatments' microbiome.</s><s>When the OTUs mapped to the family Rickettsiaceae was examined at the level of genus the predominant and sole genus detected was Wolbachia.</s><s>Rickettsiaceae is vertically transmitted from mother to offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ; however, for many of the other bacterial families present, it is difficult to discern the source or how they are incorporated into the insects' microbiome.</s><s>This is made further complicated since these traits may vary by species or genus and mapping OTUs to finer taxonomic levels was generally not possible.</s><s>Similarly, it may be possible to determine some origins via comparison with the water in rearing pans over time, although there was no DNA found in water at the start of the experiments.</s><s>However, our focus was not on the origin of bacterial species in these mosquitoes, and we do not have these data.</s><s>Analyses or the microbial community in such pans would be an interesting follow-up study.</s><s>Interestingly, Enterobacteriaceae, which includes the genus Buchnera and other common endosymbionts, is the predominant family of the third instars in the control treatment.</s><s>For example, the gut symbiont of the plataspid stinkbug (Megacopta punctatiss) is phylogenetically similar to Buchnera species <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In potato psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli) various genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae have been reported in the life stages and faeces accounting for at least 21% of the microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Enterobacteriaceae is one of, if not the most important family of endosymbionts in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and is commonly used in research regarding the effects of antibiotics on insect-symbiont interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, Chouaia et al. (2012) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> described a slowing of larval development in Anopheles mosquitoes when they removed Asaia bacteria from the family Acetobacteraceae.</s><s>However this family has one of the lowest proportionalities in all of the mosquitoes including control treated.</s><s>This suggests it is not an endosymbiont of this Culex mosquito species.</s><s>However, reports of the effects of other PPCPs on insect-symbiont interactions are rare.</s></p><p><s>It is interesting that the hormones found in wastewater from treatment plants (and in the hormone treatment groups) are all mammalian female sex hormones and would not be expected to affect bacteria.</s><s>We would not expect an effect of these hormones on bacteria, as they have no endocrine system; nonetheless, substantial changes in the microbiome occurred in response to exposure to these hormones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, caffeine and an antihistamine, would not be expected to effect biofilms, but were shown to repress respiration in stream biofilms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>We think there may be some influence the hormones have on bacterial gene expression however that is not in the scope of this paper and thus, specific effects for each PPCP or combination of contaminants will need to be determined from more experimental data.</s></p><p><s>The increased bacterial diversity during mosquito ontogeny could result from either bacterial replication during development or by acquisition through ingestion.</s><s>In the hormone and control treatment groups, we are unsure if bacteria are lost during development, or if the change in bacterial diversity was caused by differential growth among taxa.</s><s>Interestingly, in pairwise comparisons of the hormone treated mosquitoes (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), the majority of the significant differences were between second and fourth instar larvae.</s><s>The hormone treated mosquitoes also had the most families that were correlated to the first principal component at a minimum of 85%.</s><s>Combined this suggests that the mosquitoes exposed to hormones had the most diverse microbial communities and that this diversity increases over time.</s></p><p><s>Mammalian hormones change the microbiome of C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes and it is possible they are responsible for the increased richness and diversity seen in the mixture treatments compared to antibiotics alone; however more studies will need to be conducted to confirm this conclusion.</s><s>Regardless, our results indicate that reclaimed wastewater has the potential to impact mosquito ecology.</s><s>Considerably more research will be required to discern how mixtures of PPCPs could affect bacterial microbiomes for important medical pests.</s><s>If similar results are found for agriculturally important insects (including either pests and/or beneficial insects) exposed to these emerging contaminants, additional research documenting the effects of increasing use of reclaimed water and associated changes to the insect microbiome will become even more important.</s><s>Similarly, because insects are a critical food source for higher trophic level organisms in terrestrial surface waters, releases of PPCPs in aquatic environments have the potential to modify the ecology of these ecosystems.</s></p></div>
