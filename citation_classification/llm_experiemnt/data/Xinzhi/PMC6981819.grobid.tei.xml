Insect CDAs show different expression patterns according to their developmental stages and tissues.</s><s>Xi et al. revealed that N. lugens CDA3 has a high expression in the midgut, while CDA1, CDA2, and CDA4 show the highest expression in the epidermis; injection of CDA1, CDA2, and CDA4 dsRNA all led to molting failure and high mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In T. castaneum, knockdown of TcCDA1 and TcCDA2 led to developmental disturbances and abnormal phenotypes, while no visible phenotypic changes were observed after injection of dsRNAs for TcCDA3-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, the functions of CDAs have not been identified in D. citri.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we identified a cDNA encoding the whole ORF of CDA3 from the genomic database of D. citri.</s><s>The DcCDA3 sequence was analyzed by bioinformatics, and its molecular characteristics and functions were predicted.</s><s>The expression profiles of DcCDA3 in different developmental stages and tissues, as well as the response to 20E treatment, were determined.</s><s>In addition, we analyzed the expression levels following immune challenges with S. aureus and E. coli, and the biological functions of the recombinant DcCDA3 protein.</s><s>These results will lay a foundation for further research on the functions of DcCDA3.</s></p></div>
