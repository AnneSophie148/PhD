<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>An artificial diet for bluegreen aphid.</s><s>Aim of this study was to develop an effective artificial diet for bluegreen aphid.</s><s>As the model organism Acyrthosiphon pisum is the closest relative to bluegreen aphid with a reference genome available, we first tested the feasibility of the pea aphid diet to rear and study bluegreen aphid.</s><s>The artificial diet was provided in a cage feeding platform optimized to minimize space occupancy compared to performing whole plant studies in the glasshouse.</s><s>A step by step preparation of the feeding cage and diet loading is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Loading the artificial diet between parafilm sheets allowed for bluegreen aphid to puncture the stretched membrane with its stylet and to feed on the provided diet.</s><s>Both the chemically defined diet described by Auclair &amp;

0.01) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results provide a proof of concept for successful supplementation of the bluegreen aphid artificial diet with RNAi molecules targeting two candidate genes that resulted in bluegreen aphid mortality.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Aim of this study was to develop an artificial diet for bluegreen aphid to employ as an effective reverse genetics tool to rapidly screen for candidate aphid genes that play an essential role in either aphid feeding or pathogenicity.</s><s>Here, we provide an optimized diet and a small cage feeding platform, including the use of relatively small quantities of artificial diet (100 µL) where bluegreen aphids settle, feed and produce nymphs.</s><s>We further showed the promising potential of this diet to uncover potential candidate genes for future use in pest control management.</s><s>Through supplementation of double stranded RNA molecules in the diet, we delivered the first report of RNA interference mediated uptake in bluegreen aphid and showed that ingestion of dsAkC002 and dsAkhbd resulted in bluegreen aphid mortality and down-regulation of their respective target genes.</s></p><p><s>We succeeded in developing an artificial diet to enhance our understanding of the feeding and pathogenicity of bluegreen aphid (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>In 1946, the first multicellular organism (Drosophila melanogaster) was reared on a chemically defined diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> but it wasn't until 16 years later that the first diet for the sap-sucking green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) was defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The formulation of an artificial diet to rear pea aphid quickly followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>We initially tested this original pea aphid synthetic diet as well as the diet with an optimized amino acid balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> but neither were suitable for bluegreen aphid as the aphids did not settle.</s><s>So even though pea aphid is the closest relative to bluegreen aphid and their host range partially overlaps as both species can infest lucerne, clover and faba bean, they cannot feed on the same artificial diet.</s><s>Next, we trialed the green peach aphid diet composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> which was also not optimized for rearing bluegreen aphid and survival numbers were reduced by half within 48 hours.</s><s>Thus, we evaluated the green peach aphid artificial diet and started modulating factors known as phagostimulants which induce insects to ingest and effectuate sustained feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Sugars are a main feeding stimulant and sucrose in particular was shown to be phagostimulatory

within 48 hours.</s><s>Survival rates were increased further by adding cholesterol, a known phagostimulant and Akhbd (B) in bluegreen aphids was recorded by qRT-PCR after two days of feeding on diet cages with diet only (light grey), diet mixed with elution buffer (black) or diet supplemented with dsRNA (dark grey).</s><s>Whilst the buffer had no significant effect, dsRNA uptake by the aphids significantly lowered the relative expression of its respective target gene; C002 (A) and Akhbd (B) (P &lt; 0.01, ANOVA).</s></p><p><s>for various insects, and previously reported to significantly extend aphid lifespan and increase fecundity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>The report focusing on optimal levels of trace metals in combination with cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> led us to reduce the manganese concentration to half the zinc concentration which led to a further increase in survivorship and resulted in an average of 92% bluegreen aphid after two days.</s><s>Compared to 75% of bluegreen aphids surviving after six days of feeding on our newly developed artificial diet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), only 50% of green peach aphids survived after six days on an 18% sucrose solution or after thirteen days on a complete synthetic diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The average nymphs produced per adult is also higher on our diet at 23 nymphs per adult compared to 19 on the green peach artificial diet.</s><s>The bluegreen aphid survivorship after six days (75%) falls in the range of first-instar pea aphid nymphs surviving on four modified artificial diets for seven days (50% to 90% survivorship) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Whilst aphids feeding on planta are more stable and produce more nymphs, this is to be expected from an artificial system versus a natural feeding environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The susceptible M. truncatula cultivar Borung was closest to the artificial diet with a bluegreen aphid nymph count of 36 compared to 23 on the artificial diet.</s><s>Despite limited space in the cage feeding platform and contamination of the diet from day five onwards, the bluegreen aphids settled well on the diet and had a stable survivorship of 75% after six days of feeding.</s></p><p><s>The successfully modified artificial diet for rearing bluegreen aphid is advantageous to study aphid behaviour since the exact chemical composition of the diet is known and remains consistent.</s><s>In host plants, on the other hand, aphids are reared on the plant's phloem composition, which is subject to environmental conditions (light, temperature, etc.) and can therefore vary.</s><s>Aphids reared in small feeding cages also require less space compared to whole plants.</s><s>Moreover, an artificial diet allows for the easy introduction or removal of molecules, making it an ideal system to study aphid gene function and discover candidate effectors.</s><s>Our newly developed artificial diet suitable for bluegreen aphid can now be used as part of a reverse genetics platform to find and characterize aphid target genes.</s></p><p><s>RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that can be used to trigger sequence specific degradation of candidate genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Targeted gene knockdown by dsRNA-mediated RNAi has been extensively used to study gene function in insects, including aphids, and has been reviewed in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Delivery methods for dsRNA in aphids are through direct micro-injection or oral administration, either diet-based or via feeding on transgenic plants.</s><s>Potential RNAi target genes have been explored in multiple aphid species including pea aphid <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref

target="#b30">[31]</ref> and green peach aphid <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Although bluegreen aphid causes major damage to grain legumes such as lupins and to various leguminous pastures such as lucerne and clover, no RNAi studies were reported to date for bluegreen aphid.</s><s>The relatively small size of this aphid compared to pea aphid is a limiting factor for RNAi delivery through direct injection as this would induce mechanical damage.</s><s>Therefore, feeding based administration of dsRNA was desirable as this provides a high-throughput strategy to test candidate target genes and can be easily translated for use in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To provide a proof of concept, we focused on two clear RNAi target genes reported to be lethal in pea aphid, the model organism and closest relative to bluegreen aphid.</s><s>Injection of short interference RNA (siRNA) targeting the salivary protein ApC002 causes a significant decrease in ApC002 transcript levels over a three day period which was reflected in only a 50% survival rate of pea aphid after three days <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Our results showed a 42% bluegreen aphid survival rate after three days of feeding on artificial diet supplemented with dsRNA targeting the homologous ApC002 gene in bluegreen aphid compared to 87.5% survival rate when feeding on diet only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>This corresponded to a significant down-regulation of the C002 transcript when feeding on diet supplementation with dsC002 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>This suggests an even higher efficiency of feeding based RNAi mediated gene silencing compared to delivery via direct injection in pea aphid <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>When green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) fed on tobacco leaf disks transiently producing dsRNA targeting the MpC002 gene, its partial silencing significantly reduced aphid reproduction rate, but not survival rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>This was in contrast to the findings in wheat aphid (Schizaphis graminum) where a complete knock-down of the SgC002 gene could cause high mortality of aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>This illustrates how silencing of homologous genes can vary significantly between different aphid species and is dependent on a multitude of factors, including the structural accessibility of the target site <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Other factors such as the effective dosage and length of the RNAi construct are important differences that need to be taken into consideration to induce optimal silencing in the target organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>We opted to supplement the artificial diet with long dsRNA since this has the benefit of generating multiple siRNA targeting the candidate gene compared to providing a single siRNA molecule.</s><s>For example, comparison of RNAi molecules in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum showed that a single siRNA was less efficient than a long dsRNA for the same target gene with the siRNA hardly triggering any phenotypic changes for intact insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The second target gene was the gap gene hunchback whose silencing through feeding supplemented dsRNA significantly raised mortality in pea aphid after three days compared to controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>The average survival rates of bluegreen aphid were as low as 40% compared to 85% in control diet after three days feeding on artificial diet with dsRNA designed against the conserved downstream segment of the hunchback homolog in bluegreen aphid (Akhbd) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>This is reflected in the down-regulation of the Akhbd transcript compared to the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>Mortality rates observed in artificial feeding bioassays can differ between target organisms and are dependent on a range of factors such as varying RNAi efficiencies in different target organisms, concentration of the RNAi molecules supplemented in the diet and daily renewal of the diet.</s></p><p><s>The successful application of feeding based RNAi in bluegreen aphid opens the possibility to screen for essential target genes in bluegreen aphid whose knockdown induces mortality or reduced fitness and performance.</s><s>The diet can also be used for the identification of aphid effectors promoting pathogenicity which can help to develop novel strategies for pest resistances in plants.</s><s>Our set-up allows for high-throughput screening as it is a fast turnover experiment, requires minimal space occupancy and is easy to implement.</s><s>Improvements could be made to the elution buffer to isolate dsRNA as it also slightly reduces survival rates compared to bluegreen aphid feeding on diet only.</s><s>Other dsRNA delivery methods in aphids should also be explored such as soaking or spraying <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>A virus-based RNAi vector expressed in citrus tree induced gene silencing of a phloem-sap sucking insect Diaphorina citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> and could be a way to hijack virus-carrying aphids.</s></p><p><s>This work forms the basis to include bluegreen aphid to the growing list of agricultural insect pests that could be managed through RNAi based control solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> with the generation of aphid-resistant wheat plants as the latest example of plant-mediated RNA interference to combat grain aphid <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>This would reduce the need for chemical insecticide use and the future risk of losing insecticide efficacy due to the development of insecticide resistance as there are many potential aphid genes that could be targeted, either individually or in groups of two or more.</s><s>The sequence specificity of RNAi mediated gene silencing allows one to target individual species thereby mitigating the risk of affecting beneficial organisms.</s><s>Our study shows that potential target genes for bluegreen aphid pest control can now be tested in a fast and efficient way via the RNAi mediated artificial diet feeding platform for bluegreen aphid.</s></p></div>
