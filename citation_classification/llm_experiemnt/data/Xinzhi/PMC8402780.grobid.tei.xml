<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Most plant viral diseases are transmitted by insect vectors in the field.</s><s>Laodelphax striatellus is a destructive agricultural pest with a wide distribution all over the world and causes the occurrence and prevalence of multiple plant viral diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Insecticides are commonly used to control the L. striatellus population in the field.</s><s>Little is known about the effects of insecticide application on virus infection in L. striatellus.</s></p><p><s>A previous study showed that application of flupyradifurone and acetamiprid, two neonicotinoid insecticides, in potato could significantly inhibit Bemisia tabaci to transmit tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) and disrupt feeding behavior of B. tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, the propagation and transmission efficiency of tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) were significantly increased in Spinosad-resistant western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>It needs to be studied whether the insecticides used to control the planthoppers can also inhibit the transmission of plant virus.</s><s>In this study, we selected four representative insecticides, including imidacloprid, deltamethrin, pymetrozine, and buprofezin, to study whether insecticides could affect RBSDV infection in L. striatellus.</s><s>The results in the present study demonstrated that application of four types of insecticides caused a significantly decrease in RBSDV abundance in L. striatellus.</s><s>The result was in keeping with the finding observed in B. tabaci, whose insecticide application reduced virus infection in insect vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Imidacloprid and deltamethrin are insecticides that act on neural targets.</s><s>A previous study has reported that the neural factor Hikaru genki homolog of the leafhopper Nephotettix cincticeps restrained the spread of the nucleorhabdovirus rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV) in the central nervous system of vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>We speculated that application of imidacloprid and deltamethrin may reduce RBSDV infection by interfering with nerve signal transmission.</s><s>In addition, imidacloprid can be used as a seed-treatment insecticide, and imidacloprid treatment can decrease the barley yellow dwarf virus-infected plants and increase the yield of the virus-infected or -uninfected susceptible oat cultivar <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Pymetrozine is a selective inhibitor of the feeding of sap-sucking insects, and buprofezin can interfere with metabolism and inhibit chitin synthesis in insects.</s><s>It was possible that pymetrozine application reduced RBSDV infection by influencing L. striatellus' feeding behavior, and buprofezin may reduce RBSDV infection by influencing L. striatellus' metabolic system.</s><s>These studies suggested that insecticides have different effects on different viruses in insects.</s><s>These insecticides have multiple properties such as high efficiency, low toxicity, and low residue.</s><s>These four types of insecticides are most widely used to control planthoppers in the fields, and insecticides should be used interchangeably.</s><s>Suitable insecticides were selected according to the resistance and virulence of pests in the field.</s></p><p><s>P450s are divided into CYP2, CYP3, CYP4, and mitochondrial CYP clades.</s><s>They play critical roles in xenobiotic metabolism and insecticide resistance in insects, especially CYP3 and CYP4 clades.</s><s>For instance, CYP3 and CYP4 clades played positive roles in neonicotinoid insecticide resistance in Nilaparvata lugens <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the application of insecticides can regulate the expression of P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, the association between P450s and

can inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The abundance of RBSDV was significantly increased in L. striatellus after PBO treatment, indicating that P450s are involved in regulating virus infection in L. striatellus.</s></p><p><s>Although P450s in many insects were already identified, they were not systematically analyzed in L. striatellus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Similar to other planthoppers, we identified 14 P450s in CYP3 clade and 21 in CYP4 clade in L. striatellus.</s><s>Among them, sixteen P450s were significantly changed after virus infection.</s><s>Similarly, a previous study has shown that the relative expression levels of detoxification enzyme genes were altered after plant virus infection in B. tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Our results indicate that P450s are response to RBSDV infection.</s><s>CYP6CW1 was the gene that increased the most, while CYP6AY3 decreased the most after RBSDV infection in L. striatellus.</s><s>Knockdown of CYP6CW1 and CYP6AY3 could increase the RBSDV abundance in L. striatellus, indicating that these two P450 genes are required for insects resisting virus infection.</s><s>How these two P450 genes regulate virus infection remains to be investigated.</s><s>L. striatellus might upregulate the expression of CYP6CW1 to suppress RBSDV infection, while CYP6AY3 expression was downregulated by RBSDV to promote virus infection.</s><s>In addition to CYP6CW1 and CYP6AY3, there are another five P450 genes in the CYP3 clade and eight P450s in the CYP4 clade that are responsive to RBSDV infection; these genes may also be involved in the regulation of virus infection in L. striatellus.</s></p><p><s>The midgut in an insect vector is an infection barrier and the salivary gland is a release barrier for the persistent virus transmitted by

expressions of CYP6CW1 in the midgut and in RB L. striatellus suggest that CYP6CW1 may play a critical role in the inhibition of virus infection in the midgut.</s><s>CYP6AY3 is downregulated after RBSDV infection, indicating that RBSDV suppresses the expression of CYP6AY3 to facilitate its infection in L. striatellus.</s><s>The low expression of CYP6CW1 in females and CYP6AY3 in males and females suggest that they may facilitate virus infection in adults.</s><s>Opposite to the expression pattern of CYP6AY3, CYP6CW1 had the highest expression level in male.</s><s>The high expression level of CYP6CW1 may enhance the ability to metabolize insecticides and to inhibit virus infection in male of L. striatellus.</s><s>In insects, the high expression level of CYP6CW1 and CYP6AY3 was reported to associate with insecticides metabolism in resistant strains, and insecticides treatment could upregulate the expression of CYP6CW1 and CYP6AY3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>CYP6CW1 was related to buprofezin resistance in a lab-selected resistant strain, and CYP6AY3v2 can hydroxylate imidacloprid in L. striatellus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>RBSDV infection can regulate P450s expression and may change the susceptibility of L. striatellus to insecticides.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results revealed the effect of insecticides and P450s on virus infection in insects.</s><s>Application of four commonly used insecticides inhibits RBSDV abundance in L. striatellus.</s><s>Treatment of P450s inhibitor PBO reduced the abundance of RBSDV in L. striatellus.</s><s>The P450 genes in CYP3 clade and CYP4 clade were systematically identified.</s><s>CYP6CW1 and CYP6AY3 in P450s CYP3 clade were differentially expressed under RBSDV infection and were required for RBSDV replication in L. striatellus.</s><s>These results provide new
