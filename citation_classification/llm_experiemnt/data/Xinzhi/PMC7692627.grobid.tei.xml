Gramineae including rice, maize, wheat and barley <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Typical symptoms of infected rice plants include stunting, darkening of leaf color, and tumors on leaves and stems.</s><s>The infected rice plants fail to produce heads when infection is established at the seedling stage.</s><s>When infection occurs at the tillering stage, the panicles are usually closed, causing severe loss of crop production <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>.</s><s>In 2013, a field survey confirmed that 333 out of 915 plants from five provinces surveyed in China were infected with RBSDV <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>RBSDV is a double-layered icosahedral virus (75-80 nm in diameter) comprised of 10 dsRNA segments (S1-S10) and 6 structural proteins which are P1, P2, P3, P4, P8 and P10 in its viral particle <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</s><s>RBSDV P10 protein is the major outer capsid protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>It is used as an indicator of RBSDV infection in disease diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>The current techniques for RBSDV are based on detection of the gene sequences or viral proteins.</s><s>For detection of RBSDV, several methods have been established, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [8], Northern blotting <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, RT-loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (RT-LAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, single small brown plant hopper RT-PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>As for detection of RBSDV in situ by immunofluorescent labeling, antibodies against RBSDV P7-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, P9-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and P10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have been adopted for localization of RBSDV in the SBPH midgut.</s><s>However, high cost culture reagents and equipment are required for these methods.</s><s>Therefore, we aimed to select a few DNA-based probes as alternatives for detection of RBSDV P10 in its transmission vector SBPH for a subcellular localization study of virus-vector interactions.</s></p><p><s>Aptamers are single-strand DNA or RNA with a length of 56-120 nt comprised of a variable region of 20-80 nt flanked by fixed primer sequences.</s><s>They form secondary structures such as hairpin loops, internal loops, bulge loops, multibranch loops or pseudoknots.</s><s>Aptamers can bind to a great variety of targets including metal ions, small molecules, proteins, lipids or cells.</s><s>Single-strand nucleotide aptamers are thermally stable and can be easily modified and applied to ELISA assays, immunofluorescent labeling, aptamer-pulldown assays, flow cytometry and drug delivery.</s><s>The small molecular size of the aptamer enhances its accessibility to target molecules, which enables it to function as a probe more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, to select a specific and sensitive aptamer for the target, the vast diversity of random sequences in the variable region of the aptamers will be affinity-based selected through a process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>During each round of the affinity selection, unbound ssDNA aptamers are washed away and the ssDNA aptamers bound to immobilized target molecules are collected and amplified in PCR to serve as the DNA library for the next round of selection.</s><s>Finally, ssDNA aptamers with a high affinity to target molecules are enriched after 10 rounds of SELEX and the sequence of candidate DNA aptamers is determined.</s></p><p><s>The screening of a ssDNA/RNA aptamer library by SELEX in each round involves the PCR amplification of the eluted aptamers for the next round of selection.</s><s>In order to maintain the relative abundance of each eluted aptamer in the library before and after PCR, despite the high complexity of the template mixture, a uniform amplification is necessary.</s><s>PCR techniques such as BEAMing (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and emulsion PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> provided valuable approaches to meet the requirements of library amplification in SELEX.</s><s>The key to uniform amplification is the physical partitioning of each template into individual micelles prior to PCR amplification, thus avoiding PCR bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and hybridized by-product formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> which have been observed when a high complexity template mixture is amplified in conventional PCR.</s><s>In this study, the concept of emulsion PCR combined with the formula of the organic phase used in BEAMing for emulsification was adopted and improved to amplify enriched aptamers in SELEX.</s></p><p><s>Aptamers have already been developed to detect animal and human viruses.</s><s>DNA aptamers selected against Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 virus particles have been successfully applied in virus diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Similar cases for other animal viruses such as Avian influenza virus H5N1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Muscovy duck parvovirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Respiratory syncytial virus [30], Human noroviruses <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Hepatitis B

reported.</s><s>However, there is only one example of plant virus detected by aptamers, the detection of Apple stem pitting virus <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we aimed to select DNA aptamers to detect the plant virus RBSDV P10 in the insect vector SBPH using an improved emulsion PCR-based SELEX method.</s><s>We also exploited the advantage of the small molecular size of aptamers which brings a greater accessibility to target molecules when entering the subcellular compartments in immunofluorescent labelling for studies of virus-vector interactions.</s></p></div>

either vigorous mixing using a tissue lyser <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">43]</ref> or vortexing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The uniformity of the emulsion created by a tissue lyser or vortexing was compared by observation using a light microscope.</s><s>The vortexing method created a more uniform emulsion than vigorous mixing using a tissue lyser.</s><s>Additionally, the organic phase was tested for thermal stability in emulsification <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>As for optimization of the ePCR composition, the MgCl 2 concentration was found to play a crucial role.</s><s>For efficient amplification of ssDNA templates in the emulsion, the MgCl 2 concentration between 3.5 and 4 mM was optimal for the ePCR when the aqueous phase was emulsified in the organic phase.</s><s>This is contrary to the 1.5 mM MgCl 2 that has been generally used in the conventional PCR.</s><s>The importance of increasing the concentration of MgCl 2 in ePCR has not been reported previously.</s><s>It turned out to be the most important factor for the effective ePCR in the aptamer amplification.</s><s>This might be due to the significantly higher (10 times) concentration of primers used in ePCR and the DNA primers competed for Mg 2+ ions.</s><s>Thus, primer DNA reduced free Mg 2+ ions available for Taq polymerases, hindering the ePCR process.</s><s>To further optimize ePCR, BSA was introduced to protect DNA polymerases from being trapped in the intermediate layers and boost PCR efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>BSA was confirmed to be useful and a very small amount (0.01 mg/mL) was sufficient for efficient ePCR.</s><s>The recovery of amplified dsDNA from the emulsion was also improved.</s><s>Instead of using the diethyl ether or isobutanol for emulsion breaking [39], water-saturated isobutanol was used to protect the aqueous phase from the hygroscopicity of pure isobutanol during phase separation.</s><s>With the use of the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit after emulsion breaking, the recovery of amplified DNA could be readily completed within 10 min.</s></p><p><s>A close monitoring of the output DNA yield and the output/input DNA ratio during SELEX provided valuable information on the enrichment of putative aptamers and standardized the whole screening process.</s><s>In a typical SELEX process, putative aptamers are enriched when the output/input DNA ratio first declines and then starts to increase with an output DNA yield of more than 3 µg, despite continuously increased stringency parameters throughout SELEX rounds.</s><s>In this study, these stringency parameters were adjusted based on the monitoring of the output/input DNA ratio to favor the enrichment of high affinity aptamers, while ensuring adequate output yield of DNA from ePCR in each round.</s></p><p><s>As for selected aptamer candidates for the RBSDV P10 protein detection, it is not possible to directly predict positive aptamers based on their sequence similarities by phylogenetic analysis.</s><s>Thus, ELONA and aptamer-based dot-blot ELISA were conducted to verify the potential application of selected putative aptamers.</s><s>The higher affinity of aptamers in ELONA did not correlate with high specificity in the aptamer-based dot-blot ELISA.</s><s>This is probably due to the insufficient negative selection.</s><s>In this study, the DNA library was negatively selected against freshly equilibrated Ni-NTA magnetic beads to reduce non-specific aptamers that interact with Ni 2+ ions or the beads matrix.</s><s>However, this process was unable to remove aptamers that potentially interacted with other SBPH proteins.</s><s>An alternative could be using RBSDV-free SBPH proteins immobilized on beads as bait to remove non-specific aptamers.</s><s>Additionally, since both the forward and reverse strands were pooled in the SELEX process, both strands from the T-A cloning constructs should be verified.</s><s>The predicted folding of an F-aptamer and its antisense R-aptamer was similar in our preliminary analysis.</s><s>However, the specificity of the binding to the target turned out to be very different, as shown in the F3/R3, F5/R5 and F11/R11 pairs.</s><s>Aptamers R3, R5 and R11 are not the strongest binders to the RBSDV P10 protein but they shared good specificity towards the RBSDV P10 protein, thus making them the preferred aptamers.</s><s>The finding of higher specificity in antisense R-aptamers and the irrelevance between the affinity and the specificity in aptamer enrichment was consistent with a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>This is the first time that aptamers were applied in immunofluorescent labeling for a plant virus insect vector.</s><s>The detection of the RBSDV P10 protein by Texas-Red-tagged aptamers R3, R5 and R11 was proven to be applicable in the immunofluorescent labeling.</s><s>Moreover, the fluorescent signals from aptamers (1 µg/mL) R5 and R11 surpassed that of the mAB (2 µg/mL), as shown by stronger signals and lower background fluorescence.</s><s>This may be due to the relatively smaller molecular weight of aptamers (~30 kDa), as compared to that of mAB IgG (~150 kDa) or smaller size of aptamers (3 nm) compared to that of mAB (10-15 nm) as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the steric hindrance of aptamers was lower, making target molecules more accessible to aptamers than to antibodies.</s><s>The FITC signal from mAB and Texas Red signal from aptamers did not always match perfectly in every pixel, especially in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> R11-merged.</s><s>This might be due to the difference in the interaction force of mAB and aptamers to the target, as mAB binds to the target mainly through van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, while aptamers bind to target mainly through electrostatic interactions.</s><s>The difference in the form of interaction could produce a slight difference in the immunofluorescent labeling.</s><s>Another explanation may be that the epitopes of the mAB and aptamers recognition sites are not identical.</s></p><p><s>In this study, three ssDNA aptamers were selected from the optimized emulsion PCR-based SELEX as specific and sensitive probes for the detection of the RBSDV P10 protein both in extracted insect proteins in vitro and in the midgut of the RBSDV-infected SBPH in situ.</s><s>The sensitivity and specificity of these three aptamers were comparable to the anti-RBSDV P10 protein mAB based on their performance in the dot-blot ELISA and the immunofluorescent localization.</s><s>These ssDNA aptamers can be modified and synthesized chemically and further developed into potential probes for detection of RBSDV.</s><s>Based on the successful screening of aptamers against the RBSDV P10 protein, the emulsion PCR-based SELEX could be applied to the selection of aptamers for other plant virus proteins.</s></p><p><s>Aptamers have been proven

virus-vector interaction studies in the future.</s><s>Although SELEX requires advanced skills and close manipulation of the parameters throughout the process, the selection of aptamers for detection of viral protein is more convenient and economical, as compared to the mAB production, with a lesser requirement of equipment and could be completed within one week.</s><s>The successful selection of aptamers R3, R5 and R11 against the RBSDV P10 protein has proven that ssDNA aptamers are viable alternatives to antibodies.</s><s>The advantages of aptamers, such as easy synthesis, easy modification
