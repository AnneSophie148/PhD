<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Most bacteria are not culturable, but can be identified through molecular methods such as metagenomics studies.</s><s>Due to specific metabolic requirements and symbiotic relationships, these bacteria cannot survive on typical laboratory media.</s><s>Many economically and medically important bacteria are unculturable; including phloemlimited plant pathogens like Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas).</s><s>CLas is the most impactful pathogen on citrus production, is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri), and lacks an effective treatment or resistant cultivars.</s><s>Research into CLas pathogenicity and therapy has been hindered by the lack of persistent pure cultures.</s><s>Work to date has been mostly limited to in planta studies that are time and resource intensive.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>We developed and optimized an in vitro protocol to quickly test the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents against CLas.</s><s>The assay uses intact bacterial cells contained in homogenized tissue from CLas-infected ACP and a propidium monoazide (PMA) assay to measure antimicrobial activity.</s><s>The applicability of PMA was evaluated; with the ability to differentiate between intact and disrupted CLas cells confirmed using multiple bactericidal treatments.</s><s>We identified light activation conditions to prevent PCR interference and identified a suitable positive control for nearly complete CLas disruption (0.1% Triton-X 100).</s><s>Isolation buffer components were optimized with 72 mM salt mixture, 1 mM phosphate buffer and 1% glycerol serving to minimize unwanted interactions with treatment and PMA chemistries and to maximize recovery of intact CLas cells.</s><s>The mature protocol was used to compare a panel of peptides already under study for potential CLas targeting bactericidal activity and identify which were most effective.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>This psyllid homogenate assay allows for a quick assessment of potential CLas-disrupting peptides.</s><s>Comparison within a uniform isolate largely eliminates experimental error arising from variation in CLas titer between and within individual host organisms.</s><s>Use of an intact vs. disrupted assay permits direct assessment of potential therapeutic compounds without generating pure cultures or conducting extensive in planta or field studies.</s></p></div>

where a single bacterium is considered alive and viable if it forms a distinct colony of cells when placed on a suitable culture material at appropriate dilution.</s><s>For bacterial species that cannot be cultured, this is clearly not suitable, requiring less direct means to characterize populations.</s><s>Among the methods that have been used are assessments of: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transcription/translation activity, metabolic activity, and maintenance of intact cell membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The assessment of cell membrane integrity has been conducted through a variety of means, mostly involving preferential exclusion or uptake of dyes or markers.</s></p><p><s>Recently described techniques combine selective exclusion of DNA-binding dyes and quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR).</s><s>A dye such as ethidium monoazide (EMA), propidium monoazide (PMA) or a derivative is added to a sample where they strongly bind DNA.</s><s>When activated through light excitation, the dyes form a covalent crosslink with the DNA and render it unavailable as PCR template.</s><s>Because the dyes do not penetrate cell membranes, any DNA within an intact cell is unaffected.</s><s>Only free DNA in solution, or in cells with compromised membranes, will be bound by the treatment.</s><s>Following this procedure, a viability q-PCR (v-qPCR, as the intact cells are putatively viable), can measure the number of intact cells through amplification of DNA targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>.</s><s>One disadvantage of v-qPCR is the possible underestimation of cell mortality, if it is not associated with cell membrane disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Of the commonly available v-PCR dyes, PMA is reported to be more likely to underestimate cell disruption, suggesting results be considered the maximum potential number of viable cells and therefore protocols should focus on maximizing the suppression of signal from dead cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>.</s><s>PMA's ability to penetrate non-viable but largely intact cells may be complicated by the presence of a large number of dead cells lowering the availability of PMA molecules to each cell.</s><s>In previous reports, these problems were mostly absent or ameliorated in experiments using combinations of appropriate wavelength light sources, sufficient incubation time, PMA concentration, light exposure, and a ratio of dead to living cells of less than 10,000:1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Psyllids and leafhoppers are by far the most important vectors of bacterial pathogens to plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The bacterial pathogens they transmit, like Candidatus Phytoplasma spp.</s><s>(phytoplasmas) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and Candidatus Liberibacter spp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> represent a major threat to food crops worldwide.</s><s>These phloem limited pathogens;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This psyllid homogenate assay now plays an important role in our pipeline for testing CLas-killing peptides, for either exogenous application or delivery as transgenes.</s><s>Work on whole trees requires a much longer experimental run, as citrus are slow-growing woody plants that take many months to develop HLB symptoms.</s><s>Using individual plants increases the variability between replicates due to the complex nature of the pathogen/host interactions.</s><s>Whole tree experiments also have substantial costs since each tree needs many work-hours for maintenance, higher amounts of therapeutic materials to attain adequate phloem concentrations, and are vulnerable to storm and cold damage.</s><s>While intact plant trials will remain essential for determining therapeutic effect, treatment concentrations and phytotoxicity, the time and costs for such trials are so great that early elimination of less successful CLas-killers is invaluable.</s></p><p><s>We selected PMAxx for this assay to minimize false positive results in on our experimental platform.</s><s>PMA dyes have been found to be less influenced than EMA by variation in bacterial cell membranes between species.</s><s>This is advantageous for an assay which may be applied to a range of poorly characterized unculturable microbes.</s><s>PMA is less efficient at suppressing the PCR signal of compromised cells then EMA, but also less likely to penetrate a viable cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>PMA treatments are generally considered to be a conservative measurement of killed cells with a much higher tendency to overestimate living cell numbers <ref type="bibr"

smaller.</s><s>This is preferred in this assay because downstream validation of CLas-killing therapies will require costly and time intensive in planta or field studies, and we would rather underestimate than overestimate treatment effects.</s><s>Conditions reported for using PMA and other photoreactive viability dyes are widely varied.</s><s>Many factors can influence the efficiency of the reaction and the magnitude of the signal generated.</s><s>These factors have been extensively reviewed by Fittipaldi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Some conditions can be easily adjusted in developing a procedure for an individual bacterium; such as light wavelength, exposure time, PMAxx or other dye concentration, and incubation times.</s><s>Some conditions are specific for individual assay systems and cannot easily be changed; like the membrane structure of the bacteria tested and the matrix in which the bacteria are collected.</s><s>Here we have identified a set of lighting conditions and buffer composition suitable for testing therapeutic compounds against intact CLas cells in an ACP-homogenate matrix.</s></p><p><s>The isolation is conducted in a dilute phosphate buffered saline solution containing glycerol.</s><s>Trials with complex culture media components (data not shown) proved inconsistent, so a minimal saline solution was selected to reduce potential interactions between peptide treatment and buffer components.</s><s>A pH buffering capacity was included to avoid pH effects as a complicating factor in maintaining intact CLas, influence on peptide action, and PMAxx function.</s><s>Tests were conducted to identify the minimum concentration of phosphate salts needed to maintain a stable pH while avoiding osmotic stress on the CLas cells.</s><s>A concentration of 1 mM was found to effectively buffer pH in both positive and negative controls without impacting intact cell numbers (data not shown).</s><s>We also tested the inclusion of glycerol in the buffer composition.</s><s>Glycerol is a well-known cryoprotector, anti-oxidant, and protein stabilizer.</s><s>It has been identified as being highly produced in cells subjected to temperature and water stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and the inclusion of glycerol in buffers is reported to improve the viability and metabolic activity of bacterial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Several trials with early buffer compositions showed a larger PMAxx effect (greater cell disruption) at early time points that lessened if cells were assayed after a recovery period.</s><s>We theorized that this discrepancy was due to a transient disruption of cell membranes through mechanical or osmotic stress allowing PMAxx to penetrate otherwise intact cells.</s><s>This was not seen in trials with the final buffer composition containing glycerol.</s><s>Adding glycerol also resulted in a significant increase in the recovery of intact CLas cells across all experiments and an increase in total DNA recovered in some experiments.</s><s>The mode of action of the glycerol is not clear.</s><s>We postulate that it may increase intact cell numbers by protecting cell membranes from stress during isolation.</s><s>It is also possible that glycerol improves cell recovery during transfer steps by altering homogenate viscosity.</s><s>This is supported by the decreased average C t (higher cell numbers) in raw homogenate and Testing of synthetic antimicrobial peptides on CLas.</s><s>Summary data from assessment of three putative AMPs, 1 mM streptomycin and 0.1% Triton-X 100.</s><s>All samples underwent a 4 h incubation and received PMAxx @ 25 μM with light @15 min.</s><s>The results from three separate experiments are summarized here.</s><s>Each experiment contained twelve replicate samples per treatment and control.</s><s>Values (ΔΔC t ) are shown as the average difference between the intact/disrupted cell ratio (ΔC t of

significant increase in ΔΔC t compared to no-peptide control (P &lt; 0.05) by non-parametric comparison no-PMAxx controls when glycerol is included (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Further research will be required for the mode of action to be conclusively determined.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the use of 0.1% Triton-X 100 as a positive control offered an ideal range of effects.</s><s>It generated a consistent and statistically significant lysis effect between 85 and 98% (ΔΔC t 2.8-5.8)</s><s>compared to water controls.</s><s>It is unlikely that such a treatment would disrupt 100% of cells as some CLas cells are likely associated with resistant biofilms.</s><s>Stronger detergents such as SDS may have generated a higher ΔΔC t , but generating 100% cell lysis would result in undetermined C t values through v-qPCR analysis.</s><s>Such a result may be incorporated at the theoretically lowest possible concentration detectable (C t 40 for 40 cycle reactions).</s><s>However, if all control replicates resulted in undetermined values, it would be difficult to rule out the possibility of failed amplification from experimental error.</s><s>Triton-X 100 acts through cell membrane disruption and has a similar mode of action as predicted for some of the assayed peptides.</s><s>Published studies on PMA have found that detergent based agents provide the highest correlation between v-qPCR results and culturability, when it is possible to test both in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>This is likely because the detergents directly impact permeability of the membrane to the dye.</s><s>Other methods, such as antibiotic treatments, may result in a non-viable cell that still possesses membrane intact enough to exclude it.</s><s>This cannot be experimentally replicated with CLas without a culturing protocol.</s><s>However, we judged that detergents were most likely to provide the best relationship between cells successfully disrupted by the positive control and viability.</s></p><p><s>All three of the peptides tested as potential CLas-killers were initially selected by the preliminary analysis methods available (in silico interaction, biophysical modeling, and tests against culturable gram negative bacteria).</s><s>Under currently available protocols, it would not be possible to further differentiate between them without in planta studies.</s><s>The homogenate assay was able to directly measure the impact of the three proposed therapeutic compounds on the intact/disrupted ratio of CLas cells.</s><s>The effectiveness of each treatment was compared to a positive control acting through analogous activity and in parallel to a commercial treatment.</s><s>Peptide 2 and peptide 3 treatments were shown to significantly reduce intact CLas cells in a method and timeframe similar to culture based assays available for other bacteria.</s><s>Initially analysis was conducted by comparing the post PMAxx C t values of treatment and control samples.</s><s>However, in subsequent use of the protocol, it was found that some peptide treatments resulted in higher or lower average DNA yields in both the PMAxx and no-PMAxx samples (data not shown).</s><s>To account for any changes in extraction or qPCR efficiency caused by experimental treatments, the analysis was changed to use the ΔΔC t method described in the results.</s></p><p><s>Adult psyllids were used as a reliable and practical source of intact CLas cells.</s><s>We also tested the suitability of collecting cells from the tissue of 4th and 5th instar ACP nymphs.</s><s>While late stage nymphs have been reported to support high titers of CLas cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, this protocol yielded very low initial concentrations when performed on a comparable mass of nymphal tissue (data not shown).</s><s>This may be due to bacteria residing in different tissues of nymphs that results in loss of CLas in the insect debris, or greater sensitivity to disruption for CLas in the nymphal matrix.</s><s>A more detailed study using nymphs of uniform ages and development would be informative, but the use of adults maximizes the ease of selection and handling while maintaining a high bacterial concentration.</s></p><p><s>The total number of adult ACP used in each assessment was based on the experimental design and influenced by the condition of the insect colony.</s><s>This protocol requires sufficient volume and CLas concentration of homogenate for each treatment.</s><s>When more replicates or treatments were desired, additional groups of ACP were homogenized and pooled.</s><s>A typical run included 4 tubes of psyllids recovering 600 µl of total homogenate.</s><s>This volume is sufficient for simultaneous testing of four peptides with both positive and negative controls.</s><s>If the initial C t value or routine psyllid colony assessment indicates a lower titer of CLas, additional tubes with less isolation buffer can be used to increase the concentration of intact bacteria.</s><s>Using higher numbers of ACP per tube was attempted, but the additional tissue obstructed the filter and resulted in an inability to recover homogenate.</s></p></div>
