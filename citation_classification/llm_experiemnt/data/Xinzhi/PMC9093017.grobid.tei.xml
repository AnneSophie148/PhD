however, this species is a member of an entirely different subgenus, and, as such, is quite far removed from the more robust data sets afforded by the melanogaster clade and the other members of Sophophora subgenus.</s><s>These factors may also mean that these distantly related species (i.e., D. mojavensis and the Drosophila subgenus) are much more difficult to utilize to assess patterns and mechanisms of evolutionary selective pressure, at least in their direct comparison with the more established molecular model species within the melanogaster clade.</s><s>Therefore, in contrast, the non-melanogaster members of the Sophophora subgenus, which itself includes substantial variation in host and habitat choice, perhaps represents a closer group of relatives to optimize the comparisons of evolutionary variation in chemosensation.</s><s>Here again, D. suzukii and its related subgroups offer an ideal, genetically tractable model for unraveling the complexities of olfactory evolution, especially given their relative phylogenetic proximity to the principal scientific models within the melanogaster clade <ref type="bibr">(Keesey et al., 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Markow, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For many Drosophila species, there already exists a robust library of molecular resources, as nearly complete genomic data sets are publicly available; however, far less information is available describing the functional components of host ecology, such as olfactory, gustatory, auditory and visual preferences, or describing behavioral or habitat variations between these species.</s><s>Thus, for most members across this incredibly well-studied genus, more is known about their genome than their ecology.</s><s>In an effort to expand our knowledge about these species, here we provide a functional olfactory comparison encompassing 20 different species within the Sophophora subgenus, with particular focus on D. suzukii and its closest relatives, in order to examine the variables and olfactory attributes that are associated with the evolutionary emergence of this insect pest.</s><s>In addition, we address how protein sequence coding of olfactory receptors correlates with the functional evolution of odorant binding and ligand selectivity, through comparison of chemosensory variation overlaid with tertiary protein structures from the available species.</s></p><p><s>Thus, in summary, the present study establishes the missing ingredients to begin understanding the trends and mechanisms of olfactory evolution, whereas also providing critical chemosensory evaluations and a foundation of knowledge across 20 species within this genus of insects.</s><s>We show that only a few OSNs of the identified orthologues between species typically display elevated levels of sequence divergence as well as functional variation between species, including both large and small deviations in olfactory responses at the periphery.</s><s>This study also proposes that the comparative approach, which examines olfactory function as well as amino acid or receptor sequence alterations and patterns of selection across a multitude of species, may provide further insight into the evolution of sensory systems.</s><s>Moreover, the identified OSN locations within this study (and the potential ORs that they contain) appear to repeatedly be important for further examination across the subgenus Sophophora, and will be potential targets for future research concerning the mechanisms of chemosensory divergence and ecological adaptation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complete screening of D. suzukii olfaction</head><p><s>In order to assess olfactory ligand spectra for all OSN types, we first revisited the classical model, D. melanogaster, where the responses of most OSNs have been previously established <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crowley-Gall et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dweck et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hallem and Carlson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lin and Potter, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mathew et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Here we again mapped out the response profile from each known receptor across the adult fly antenna and palps using a panel of 80 odorants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We found that out of 37 unique olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), only 3 are still currently without a strong ligand candidate (i.e., Or23a, Or2a, Or65a/b/c), although, in addition, several co-expressed receptors also have poorly defined response profiles (e.g., Or33a, which is found in OSN ab4B).</s><s>Next, we shifted our focus toward the antenna and palps of D. suzukii using the same diverse panel of 80 odorants in order to examine any changes in functional ligand spectra between these two species.</s><s>Here we determined that of the 37 OSNs found in D. suzukii, 32 out of 37 OSNs are functionally conserved between the two species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>We identified only five OSNs that showed robust functional deviation from the D. melanogaster model, including the ab2B-like, ab3A-like, ab9B-like, ab10A-like, and ai3A-like sensory neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>Data on the palps of D. suzukii were more difficult to confirm, for example, whether each sensillum contained only two OSNs.</s><s>This is also owing to the reduced literature and molecular support available from other papers addressing the palps of most Drosophila species.</s><s>However, we did not find enough evidence to determine that any additional OSNs were functional in the D. suzukii palp screens, though future studies will need to address this olfactory organ in more detail, especially pb1 sensilla.</s><s>We also documented changes across ab5 and ab7 on the antennae of D. suzukii, though not as strong (i.e., weak), and we note that we found in total very few ab8 sensilla across D. suzukii trials.</s><s>Two of the larger deviations in olfactory response for D. suzukii have been previously described, including ab2B and ab3A <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keesey et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in the present study, we identified two distinctly responding ab3A OSN types, with an approximately 60:40 split ratio for OSN abundance, where the first (type i) was tuned toward isobutyl acetate (IBA) and the second (type ii) responded most strongly to beta-cyclocitral (bCC).</s><s>In the last few years, increasing evidence has been provided to support the notion that the closest relative for D. suzukii is actually Drosophila subpulchrella, and not Drosophila biarmipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hickner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ramasamy et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A D E C B</formula><p><s>Here we identify for the first time a second species that responds strongly to beta-cyclocitral, namely D. subpulchrella (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), which further supports an ecological the connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keesey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pin ˜ero et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Although the ecology of D. subpulchrella is understudied, based on the serrated ovipositor (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>), it has been assumed that it also lays eggs in fresh or ripening fruit resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atallah et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ramasamy et al., 2016)</ref>, just like the D. suzukii pest.</s></p><p><s>Both of these ab3A-type OSNs in D. suzukii were tuned quite differently than those found within the corresponding sensillum of D. melanogaster, which is tuned instead toward ethyl hexanoate (EH).</s><s>However, both species (and both types and type ii, in D. suzukii) share identical ligand spectra for the second OSN in the same ab3 sensillum, which responds characteristically toward 2-heptanol as the strongest excitatory ligand.</s><s>We also found that although the ab2B OSN from D. suzukii deviates from D. melanogaster, the ab2A OSN appears identical.</s><s>As such, we believe these two sensilla in D. suzukii (ab2-like and ab3-like) provide the strongest match for the comparative sensilla in D. melanogaster, despite the deviations in ligand spectra for select OSNs.</s><s>This idea is further supported by the morphological structure of the sensillum (i.e., large basiconic), and by the large amplitudes that are characteristic of these sensillum types relative to the small basiconics.</s><s>All these factors combine to strongly support the identity of these two sensillum types in D. suzukii adults, despite the variation in olfactory ligand spectra, as previously proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keesey et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conservation of neuronal wiring despite ligand spectrum shifts</head><p><s>To continue to explore the neural pathways for the ab2-and ab3-like OSNs in D. suzukii, we next documented the circuitry from the antenna toward the antennal lobe (AL) using the single-sensillum backfill neuronal staining technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hansson et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>By comparing the labeled glomeruli from D. suzukii with the known AL atlas of D. melanogaster (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B-1E</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grabe et al., 2016)</ref>, we could provide additional support for the ab2 and ab3-like sensillum type identification, as these two fly species shared identical wiring for the corresponding OSNs, despite the observed deviation in ligand spectra for D. suzukii adults.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial mapping of sensillum subtypes</head><p><s>We next mapped the position of all sensillum subtypes on the D. suzukii and D. melanogaster antenna and palps using several individuals to create an aggregate diagram.</s><s>The heads of both D. suzukii and D. melanogaster were positioned in four ways to completely map the spatial pattern for sensillum abundance, including antennal arista down, arista side, arista up as well as across the maxillary palp (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A-2D</ref>).</s><s>Here, as we had established ligand spectra for all OSNs of both species, we used SSR data to document the position of each sensillum type on the antenna (n = 6-8 individuals), which provided spatial information as well as the relative abundance (where each dot represents the approximate location of each recorded sensillum), and these data matched previous studies of D. melanogaster antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Linz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Stensmyr et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The positioning of each specific sensillum type was nearly identical in both species and arranged in concentric circles or zones;

various expression systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hallem et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Katada et al., 2003)</ref>, it has remained elusive how chemical ligands interact with their corresponding receptors.</s><s>Perhaps most importantly, the evolution of olfactory systems of related species occupying different ecological niches remained unexplored.</s><s>Only recently, progress has been made regarding predictions of unique receptor-ligand interactions.</s><s>For example, either for predicting a novel ligand based on chemical similarity using the ligand of interest and already established ligands of a similar receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Haddad et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schmuker et al., 2007)</ref>, or for predicting a receptor function based on sequence similarities with another receptor using previously established ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chepurwar et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Here we analyze the olfactory response profiles of different olfactory receptors in 20 closely related Drosophila species.</s><s>We first started by identifying all 37 OSN types in D. melanogaster and D. suzukii (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and then highlighting those OSN types that deviate strongly in their olfactory function (e.g., ab2B, ab3A, ab9B, ab10A, and ai3A).</s><s>We next characterized 10 OSN responses across another 18 species from the Sophophora subgenus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), where we found that the ab2B neurons showed conserved responses to ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate in the majority of the species; however, seven species exhibited completely non-overlapping response patterns in this OSN type.</s><s>Here we propose that a series of olfactory receptor replacements is the most viable evolutionary explanation for this chemosensory variation across our 20 members of the Sophophora subgenus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Contrary to the ab2B neurons, the ab3A neurons of the 20 total species exhibited only gradually changed chemical response profiles, suggesting that perhaps homologues of the same receptor (i.e., Or22a in D. melanogaster) are expressed in ab3A neurons of all species tested.</s><s>By correlating these ligand response profiles with the species-specific Or22a receptor sequences (e.g., for those 14 species, where the sequences were available) we were able to localize the top 20 amino acid positions that determine the functional response profile of this receptor protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, 3D modeling of the receptor protein localized these 20 amino acids into two distinct spatial regions that had already been suggested to be involved in determining receptor specificity or ligand binding pocket <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Auer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Butterwick et al., 2018) (Figures 5F and 5G)</ref>.</s><s>Although standard tests for positive selection across OR22a genes were negative, we found evidence for trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection.</s><s>Our finding that OR22a sequences bear putative signals of relaxation of purifying selection as well as episodic positive selection acting at specific functional sites of OR22a could be explained by the broader functional response profile of the OR22a receptor, permitting the evolution of new ecological adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andersson et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, based on the sequence locations for these 20 amino acid positions across the functional receptor of each species, we could begin to predict receptor function across novel Drosophila species with previously unmatched accuracy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>An important observation from our dataset is that some OSN locations are far more likely to change than others, for example, we observe consistent alterations in ab2B and ab3A across our 20 species, whereas other OSNs remain functionally identical as well as continue to be highly conserved in their amino acid sequence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>One explanation for these specific OSN changes could be related to yeast or hostspecific microbial odorants.</s><s>It has been shown previously for Drosophila species that yeast control attraction and oviposition more so than the host plant material <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Becher et al., 2012)</ref>; thus, it is possible that the repeated alterations in olfactory function of these OSNs, especially ab2B and ab3A, are related to yeastspecific and ecologically vital odors for each fly species <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Koerte et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Another possible explanation for the observation that elevated levels of amino acid sequence variation between species more consistently occurs for a particular OR could be related to the stability of tertiary structures, especially within transmembrane regions or putative binding pockets, or the stability during folding of the protein sequence itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chepurwar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dalton et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In a similar fashion, it is also possible that a stability explanation could account for why some amino acid regions within a protein sequence are also more likely to change.</s><s>For example, it is unclear why amino acid positions 45, 67, or 93 of the Or22a sequence display lower levels of sequence conservation between six species within the melanogaster clade <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Auer et al., 2020)</ref>, a general region we also show is consistently variable across our 20 examined species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>It could also be argued that relaxed constraints at the amino acid sequence level are not necessarily reflected at the level of tertiary structure in cases where the amino acid changes are conserved (i.e., basic amino acids are exchanged for another basic amino acid).</s><s>Here, less conserved parts of the ORs might carry many changes in coding sequences that are neutral since they do not affect function.</s><s>In cases with ligand shifts, instead, the observed amino acid changes could be in positions that allow variability in ligand binding, potentially changing the odorant perceived (i.e., bound) by a particular OR.</s><s>Moreover, it is likely that several specific regions of the protein sequence and corresponding tertiary structure are excellent candidates to further examine how specific amino acid substitutions relate to ligand spectra shifts between species, or perhaps toward the stability of ligand binding affinities within the binding pocket <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Auer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dalton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"

including ab2B, ab3A, ab9B, ab10A, and ai3A, where several of these receptors in D. suzukii were predicted to be functionally divergent, according to the analyses of genomic data alone <ref

primarily focus on the two large basiconic sensillum types (e.g., ab2 and ab3), and further document that, although their odorant tuning differs, D. suzukii appears to maintain the same neural connectivity to the primary olfactory processing centers within the AL (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B-1E</ref>).</s><s>However, it was shown recently in D. simulans that even when peripheral odorant spectra are conserved, changes in neural circuitry can occur in the higher brain regions, and can lead to behavioral valence shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Seeholzer et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, additional work should be conducted to assess neural connections in D. suzukii for variations that may not be apparent at the periphery or within the input side of the AL.</s></p><p><s>Another interesting phenomenon that we observe is that there are seemingly two different functional types of the ab3A-like neuron in this pest insect, one that is tuned toward IBA, and the other toward bCC, where both functional types are found in the same animal.</s><s>This suggests that sensillum types across the antenna are non-uniform, and that OR gene duplication events and sequence divergence are potentially important, perhaps playing a wider role in the evolution of species-specific use of olfactory cues (e.g., Or22a, which has six functional duplications in D. ananassae).</s><s>Here we propose that variation of expression may exist between gene duplications, and could vary between individuals within the same population.</s><s>Alternatively, duplication events may allow new copies to have relaxed constrains on the amino acid sequence as long as the original OR retains its function.</s><s>However, we again note that the ab3B OSN remains identical between these two types of ab3 in D. suzukii as well as identical to that recorded from D. melanogaster adults (i.e., detecting 2-heptanol).</s><s>Thus, both ab3B (Or85b) and ab2A (Or59b) can act as anchors for identifying ab2-like and ab3-like sensilla within all 20 examined Drosophila, as these OSNs are highly conserved and seemingly identical throughout our Sophophora phylogeny despite the paired OSN in the same sensillum often shifting ligand affinity (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Here we posit that receptor copies may be differentially expressed (in location and relative abundance) across the antenna, potentially promoting disparities in ecological preferences.</s><s>This may also support

we also propose that a developmental exchange between larval and adult copies of Or22a/Or22b and Or22c could also account for D. suzukii adults detecting bCC, as this odorant matches closely with the best-known ligand for Or22c (a receptor usually only expressed in larval stages for D. melanogaster and that detects 2-acetylpyridine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Mathew et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In D. melanogaster, many ORs are adult-or larval-specific, and are only functionally expressed during those developmental stages.</s><s>Here we posit that these stage-specific OR expression patterns may vary between species.</s><s>To our knowledge, genetic comparisons of olfaction across species are generally done from adult or larval tissues only, but we hypothesize that evolutionary gains and losses of receptors may be better explained through the inclusion of expression patterns from both life stages for more species.</s><s>In general, it is possible that larval and adult stages within a species display different olfactory preferences to reduce competition between themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dweck et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr"

increase of the ab2-like sensillum within this genus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), which is in contrast to the well-studied melanogaster clade that instead has a general increase in the ab3-like sensillum.</s><s>As such, we continue to compile additional strong support for the notion that relative size and energy allocation toward a particular odorant is indicative of

which, in turn, now detect ripening fruit odors (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), thus seemingly pushing the suzukii clade further toward an ecological niche and host preference that is different from the melanogaster clade.</s></p><p><s>As more effort is devoted toward research into the relatives of D. melanogaster, an assumption has been made that this species group is an ecological model for the entire Drosophila genus.</s><s>However, current data illustrate that the melanogaster clade is in fact the most divergent from the other members of the Sophophora subgenus, where most of the tested species, as well as the more basal species in the phylogeny, show an ab3A odorant tuning toward IBA and not EH or MH odorants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Here we also note that most basal species also have different ligands for the ab2B OSN (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our data mirror the hypothesis that the adaptation of the melanogaster clade toward human commensalism and a cosmopolitan lifestyle, which is built around fallen, fermenting fruit, perhaps related to human agriculture, is purported to be a more recently derived phenotype for this subgroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mansourian et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, it is likely that the ecological preference for fermented, as opposed to ripe fruit, has perhaps evolved multiple times across the Sophophora subgenus, given that we observe odorant tuning toward EH and MH several times within our screen of 20 species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we note this potential fermenting fruit preference in D. ananassae, D. birchii, Drosophila ficusphila, and again for Drosophila takahashii, in addition to the six members of the melanogaster clade that we examine.</s><s>At least for D. takahashii, a member of the suzukii clade, this fermentation preference was tested and confirmed in previous behavioral trials, where this species preferred to oviposit in fermented strawberries as opposed to ripe fruits <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Karageorgi et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>As such, an additional study is required to continue to test our hypotheses about the ecological rationales for ligand spectra shifts in these other understudied Drosophila species.</s><s>However, we feel the functional, olfactory evidence we provide in the present study supports the idea that ab3A (e.g., Or22a/Or22b in D. melanogaster) is strongly associated with host choice, either for feeding or perhaps indirectly for oviposition preferences as well.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the changes documented for the ab3A-like OSN, we also show a series of changes throughout our 20 Sophophora species for the ab2B-like OSN.</s><s>In D. melanogaster, this OSN expresses Or85a, and whereas we find 13 of the 20 species retain the same ligand as D. melanogaster (i.e., E3HB), we also uncover seven species with widely varied ligand spectra for this OSN (Figure <ref type="figure"

different ligands of OR22a between species contrasts with the results obtained with ab2B/ Or85a, which responds to an entirely unique odorant in D. suzukii, and is narrowly tuned.</s><s>Thus, several options exist to explain this occurrence.</s></p><p><s>First, it is possible that Or85a is a non-functional pseudogene that is not expressed in D. suzukii or that this OR is not transported to the cell membrane by the Orco chaperone.</s><s>In this case, it would be likely that a different receptor is instead expressed in this OSN location as a replacement, and that this new receptor provides the unique SSR response profile that we describe <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Prieto-Godino et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>In this scenario, the closest olfactory receptor match for the observed ligand spectrum in D. suzukii would be Or47a from D. melanogaster, which is co-expressed with Or33b within the ab5B sensillum subtype.</s><s>Whether the coexpression of ORs within an OSN is correlated with receptor replacement has yet to be tested.</s><s>Similarly, we suggest that other species may have also replaced Or85a within the ab2B OSN.</s><s>For example, we predict that D. affinis may have replaced Or85a with Or43a, given the response to methyl indole.</s><s>Moreover, in D. ananassae, Or85a may have been substituted with Or9a, given the ligand specificity toward 3-hydroxy-2-butanone. Second, it is also possible that Or85a is only predicted to be a non-functional pseudogene from the genomic analyses of D. suzukii owing to a premature stop codon.</s><s>In this case, a shortened sequence for Or85a in D. suzukii might retain functional expression, albeit with a completely unique ligand spectrum, and thus Or85a acts as a pseudo-pseudogene, which is a phenomenon that has been previously described in D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Prieto-Godino et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, this has only been documented for an ionotropic glutamate receptor (IR), and the present suggestion could be the first known case of an OR that acts as a pseudo-pseudogene.</s><s>In either case, we demonstrate that a functional receptor exists at this OSN location in D. suzukii, and that the ligand spectrum deviates strongly from that found in D. melanogaster.</s><s>Interestingly, we also document this same type of occurrence for ab2B in six other Drosophila species from our screen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), where in each case, the ligand spectrum is entirely species-specific, and does not overlap with any other known species.</s><s>This is unlike the slow changes or gradual shifts observed in ab3A/Or22a (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), where olfactory deviations in ligand spectra are often shared across several species.</s><s>However, an additional possibility for ab3A is that a duplicate copy of Or22a, which contains several premature stop codons and therefore looks like a pseudogene, could be, in fact, a pseudo-pseudogene as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ramasamy et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>This new copy of Or22a could then be expressed in one of the two ab3A subpopulations of D. suzukii, and change or alter the response of the neuron.</s><s>With all this in mind, whatever the cause for this change in the ab2B and ab3A OSNs, we show it occurs repeatedly, and that it is therefore likely to provide a new avenue for rapid olfactory evolution throughout the Sophophora subgenus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Recent research into D. melanogaster has also highlighted an additional large basiconic, currently named abx(3), that is indistinguishable from ab3 based on morphological and morphometric features, though its receptor identity and function have yet to be characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gonzales et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Throughout the previous examinations of the olfactory system of several species within the genus Drosophila, several mechanisms have been proposed for the evolution of chemosensory receptors.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that alterations in the neural circuitry of the P1 neurons (or neurons in

provide several new examples of the latter two of these mechanisms, both by illustrating a ligand spectrum shift at the periphery and providing robust evidence for sweeping changes in the relative abundance of OSN types.</s><s>Intriguingly, we find that these two mechanisms often co-occur, that is, when ligands change their binding affinity, we also notice changes in relative sensillum abundance connected to those same OSN types.</s><s>As such, it is difficult to determine what changes first in the timeline of olfactory evolution, ligand specificity, or receptor expression.</s><s>Therefore, future studies of Drosophila should continue to compare closest relatives or entire clades of species in order to determine the potential chronology of evolution, which may or may not have a consistent temporal mechanism within this genus.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we highlight that understanding the evolution of olfaction requires not just the determination of which chemical odorant is detected by a given OSN, but also how the relative abundance of those detectors combines to generate a more holistic view of olfactory function within the Drosophila phylogeny.</s><s>We identify several repeated examples of functional chemosensory evolution.</s><s>First, we show that receptor expression can vary according to changes in relative sensillum number,

).</s><s>Third, we show that few amino acid sequence changes can lead to variations in ligand affinity that are often shared between close phylogenetic relatives (i.e., Or22a).</s><s>Lastly, from our data, we identify drastic changes in odorant detection within the ab2B sensillum that, in D. melanogaster, contains Or85a.</s><s>Here we propose that a series of olfactory receptor replacements is the most viable explanation for this chemosensory variation across our 20 members of the Sophophora subgenus.</s><s>Importantly, we emphasize that all chemosensory changes are highly targeted, and repeatedly affect only the same subset of genomic and neural locations.</s><s>These locations may commonly correlate with gene duplications events or sites of receptor co-expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Auer et al., 2021)</ref>, which may serve as potential mechanisms for ecological and evolutionary shifts in host preference.</s><s>Thus, olfactory evolution across these 20 species appears to be highly repeatable in regards to where chemosensory changes consistently occur.</s><s>Future studies should continue to examine all possible mechanisms to explain why some OR OSN locations are far more likely to shift than others within the Sophophora subgenus.</s></p><p><s>It is important to note that the persistent dearth of viable ecological and natural history information for the majority of the known Drosophila species makes the subsequent extrapolation toward evolutionary pressures, ecological mechanisms, or roles of niche partitioning difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Keesey et al., 2019c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Keesey et al., , 2020))</ref>.</s><s>This paucity of ecological and host information leaves several species without known ligands for either ab2B or ab3A, despite a chemically diverse and robust screening of these OSNs in the present study using known host materials from other members of this subgenus.</s><s>As such, we continue to implore the expansion of scientific research to include a wider array of non-melanogaster species, especially those investigations that could provide ecological, host, and environmental, habitat, or behavioral rationales for morphological and chemosensory variation.</s><s>We expect that as increased efforts are placed on additional Drosophila species, in future, we may identify and test additional hypotheses or explanations for the observed olfactory shifts within this incredibly diverse genus of flies.</s><s>Through the utilization of the comparative method to study sensory biology (i.e., auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile cues) and behavioral ecology (i.e., feeding, oviposition, attraction, and aversion), we can continue to increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which evolution shapes the nervous system.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study</head><p><s>We tested many aspects of functional olfaction, including relative abundance of sensillum types or estimates of olfactory receptor copy numbers within and between many different species.</s><s>We also tested chemosensory sensitivity toward the same odorant or chemosensory variation in the strongest excitatory ligands for a particular OSN or location.</s><s>However, we did not test any behavioral variables.</s><s>Thus, it will be important in the future to address how (and if) biological variance in sensitivity or ligand type (e.g., changes in response to CO 2 or EH/MH odorants) predicts valence (i.e., attraction versus aversion) and the strength of any induced activity at the organismal level.</s><s>These behaviors will also be critical to better understand concentration dependent valence, where high levels can be attractive to some but not all species that functionally detect the same odorants.</s><s>It is also worth noting that whereas we test several replicates across individuals within a species, population variance does occur, including genetic variability in OR type and function, even in extremely well-studied model species such as D. melanogaster.</s><s>Future research will be required to confirm whether the species-specific differences we identify and describe are typical of all populations of the species we focused upon in this study.</s></p></div>

	<note type="raw_reference">Positive selection analysis A codon-based alignment of the OR coding sequences was generated using MUSCLE (UPGMA Cluster method) implemented in MEGA X (Version 10.0.5). BUSTED (Branch-site Unrestricted Statistical Test for Episodic Diversification) provides a gene-wide test for positive selection by asking whether a gene has experienced positive selection at minimum one site on at least one branch (Murrell, B et al. &quot;Gene-wide identification of episodic selection.&quot; Mol. Biol. Evol. 32, 1365-1371 (2015)). Signatures of diversifying selec- tion were inferred using aBSREL (adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood) an improved version of the commonly-used &quot;branch-site&quot; models, as implemented in Datamonkey (https://www.datamonkey. org). Significance was assessed using the Likelihood Ratio Test at a threshold of p = 0.05, after correcting for multiple testing. RELAX was useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection (and not to test for positive selection as such) on a given gene. A significant result of k &gt; 1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified along the test branches, and a significant result of k &lt; 1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed along the test branches (Wertheim JO, Murrell B, Smith MD, Kosakovsky Pond SL, Scheffler K. RELAX: detecting relaxed selection in a phylogenetic framework. Mol Biol Evol. 2015 Mar;32(3):820-32. https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu400). RELAX Test for selection relaxation (K = 0.32) was significant (p = 0.000, LR = 162.68). We used MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) to identify sites which have experienced episodic positive selection (Murrell B, Wertheim JO, Moola S, Weig- hill T, Scheffler K, Kosakovsky Pond SL. Detecting individual sites subject to episodic diversifying selection. PLoS Genet. 2012;8(7):e1002764. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764). MEME was run in Data- monkey (https://www.datamonkey.org) using standard parameters and a p value threshold of 0.05.</note>
