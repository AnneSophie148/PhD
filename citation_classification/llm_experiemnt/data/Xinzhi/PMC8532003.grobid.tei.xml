of all known plant viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>The horizontal transmission and spread of vector-borne viruses relies on the movement of insect vectors, which could be manipulated by vector-borne viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism by which viruses manipulate vector behaviors has largely been described as indirect manipulation through modifications of the quality, color, odor and associated plant traits.</s><s>For instance, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) accelerates the emigration of aphid vectors by reducing host plant quality, and increased the attractiveness of infected plants to aphid vectors by inducing elevated emissions of a volatile blend <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Potato leafroll virus (PLV) infection changes the volatile blend of potato to attract vector aphids, thereby increasing the probability of virus acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, some vector-borne viruses could manipulate vector behavior via directly affecting the nervous and olfactory system.</s><s>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) reduces whitefly preference to viruliferous plant by disabling the nervous system of vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBDV) and tomato chlorosis virus (TCV) are able to regulate the gene expression of odorant-binding protein (OBP) 2 and OBP3 in their vectors, Sogatella furcifera and Bemisia tabaci, respectively, and to reverse the preferences of nonviruliferous/viruliferous vectors, finally affecting the virus transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, various vector-borne viruses have developed the ability to utilize a direct or indirect manipulation mechanism to induce behavioral changes of insect vectors, to benefit their spread.</s><s>However, the effect of vector-borne virus infection on the olfactory system of insect vectors has not been fully elucidated.</s></p><p><s>The critical roles of the insect's olfactory system in their locomotion, host seeking, probing and feeding are mainly executed via detecting semiochemicals by sensilla on the main periphery, such as the main chemoreception organ, the antennae <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>A number of protein families located in these peripheral sensory organs are responsible for the recognition of semiochemicals, which include two classes of carrier proteins: OBPs and chemosensory proteins (CSPs), and four classes of membrane proteins: ionotropic (IR), gustatory (GRs), membrane-bound odorant receptors (ORs)/olfactory co-receptor receptor (ORco) and sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>When environmental chemicals penetrate the pores of sensilla, OBPs and CSPs as carriers bind these chemicals in the sensilla lymph and transport the chemicals to ORs or IRs located on the olfactory sensory neurons.</s><s>Then, chemical signals are converted into electrical signals, and conveyed to the insect's brain to eventually modulate the insect's behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Thus far, the role of olfactory-related proteins in virus transmission remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>Rice stripe virus (RSV), a typical member of the genus Tenuivirus, has inflicted serious yield losses of rice by causing the notorious rice stripe disease in Eastern Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>It is transmitted by the small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus (Fallen), in a persistent, circulative-propagative manner <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>RSV particles enter L. striatellus via the alimentary canal during feeding and initially establish infection in the midgut epithelium, propagating in midgut visceral muscles.</s><s>After transferring into the hemolymph, these virus invade several key organs via lymph circulation and, ultimately, arrive at the salivary gland, from which RSV particles are inoculated back to the plant hosts along with saliva.</s><s>RSV transmission in L. striatellus requires specialized interactions between components of the virus and vector, evidenced by the transcriptome analyses of the expression changes of overall mRNA genes and the regulation of RSV-derived siRNA in L. striatellus after RSV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the organ-specific transcriptomes of L. striatellus' alimentary canal and salivary gland characterize the responses of two organs in confronting RSV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions between RSV and chemoreception organs remains unknown at the omic level.</s></p><p><s>Our preliminary antennae-specific transcriptome analysis identified 14 OBPs, 12 CSPs, 7 SNMPs and 95 ORs in L. striatellus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Meanwhile, viruliferous L. striatellus might have a stronger olfactory and seeking ability for rice than nonviruliferous insect <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the current study aims to further investigate the host preference mechanism of viruliferous L. striatellus and the role of the olfactory system in RSV transmission.</s><s>We compared the response of the antennae, legs and heads (without antennae) from both L. striatellus females and males to RSV infection using next-generation deep-sequencing techniques.</s><s>Furthermore, olfactory related genes from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of chemoreception organ transcriptomes were enriched between viruliferous and nonviruliferous organs.</s><s>Lastly, a qPCR was performed to confirm the expression changes of three OBPs between viruliferous and nonviruliferous tissues.</s><s>Our results would not only improve our understanding on the role of the olfactory chemoreception organs system in RSV infection and transmission but also provide new insights into the symbiosis interaction between virus, insect and plant.</s><s>A deeper understanding of this interaction provides new avenues for controlling plant viruses and their vectors.</s></p></div>
