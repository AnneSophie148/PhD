<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Plants are open systems that constantly acquire water and nutrients from the soil and interact with the vast biological diversity of the surroundings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Médiène et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This diversity encompasses other plants, animals (i.e., protozoa, annelids, nematodes, arthropods, and vertebrates) and microorganisms.</s><s>The complex interaction among these diverse players influences crop health and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atangana et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>A better understanding of the outcome of these interactions is crucial for improving sustainable crop management and at the same time for identifying new approaches of pest management.</s></p><p><s>Insects and other invertebrates can transmit diverse microbial plant pathogens (e.g., viruses, phytoplasmas, fungi, and bacteria).</s><s>Most insect vectors belong to the Hemiptera, an order characterized by piercing and sucking mouthparts that enable feeding from phloem or xylem vessels and, consequently, allow them to acquire and transmit phytopathogens.</s><s>For example planthoppers and leafhoppers can transmit numerous phytoplasmas, viruses and bacteria <ref type="bibr">(Harris and Maramorosch, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>The transmission of insect-borne pathogens and the ecological role of insects as vectors of pathogenic microorganisms have been deeply studied in numerous crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Weintraub and Beanland, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Mechanistically, there are similarities (modes of acquisition and delivery) in the insect-mediated transmission of individual mutualists and pathogens between plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bright and Bulgheresi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pèrez-Brocal et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, little is known about the effects of transmitting entire communities of mutualist symbionts and the implications of this transmission in plant host fitness.</s><s>In addition, information regarding the potential use of transmitted mutualists as a prophylactic tool in plant protection and the ecological implications of a possible natural inoculation with such microorganisms by phloemfeeding insects is lacking.</s></p><p><s>We chose the American grapevine leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), as insect model because this species has been largely studied as vector of the flavescence dorée phytoplasma (FDP).</s><s>S. titanus is monovoltine and specialist on grapevine, which means that it lives and feeds on grapevine from hatched nymphs to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chuche and Thiéry, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The life cycle of the insect begins in summer with the egg laying in the bark of woody stems of grapevine, followed by a winter diapause with gradual hatchings occurring from May to early August.</s><s>Nymphs (five instars) remain most of the time on the abaxial side of leaves of the plant they hatched on.</s><s>Under laboratory conditions, at a temperature of 23-25 • C, the time lapse from egg hatching to adulthood is ∼30 days.</s><s>The adults can live for several weeks and females survive on average 60 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jermini et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>S. titanus is mainly a phloem feeder, although mouth stylets can evenly pierce both phloem and xylem vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chuche et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>While feeding, the insect can acquire FDP that can be then transmitted to other grapevines in a persistent-propagative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Foissac and Wilson, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The transmission process includes an incubation period of about 1 month during which phytoplasmas multiply, mostly in the fore-and mid-gut, and accumulate in the salivary glands until they reach a density that permits transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chuche and Thiéry, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The efficiency of FDP acquisition is correlated with phytoplasma titer in the source plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Galetto et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The transmission is non-transovarial, which means that newborn nymphs do not carry the microorganism, but rather they acquire it from infected plants.</s><s>S. titanus engages in multiple symbioses with bacteria, including Cardinium sp., Asaia sp., and yeast-like endosymbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sacchi et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Endophytes asymptomatically colonize the inner tissues of plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schulz and Boyle, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Plant colonization mechanisms of bacterial endophytes are complex and symbiosis genes in the genomes of the microbe, inter-kingdom signaling between the plant and the bacterium and plant immunity may play important roles in it, as is the case in many other plant-microorganisms interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Iniguez et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kusari et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The colonization of the plant may result in effects that span from plant growth promotion by nitrogen fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Santoyo et al., 2016)</ref> to antagonistic properties against plant pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rabha et al., 2014)</ref> and synthesis of exogenous plant hormones that mediate developmental processes in the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Khan et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Colonization of bacterial endophytes is tissuespecific <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Quadt-Hallmann et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>While many endophytic bacteria can infect and colonize the plant tissues through the roots and move up to the stems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Compant et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Compant et al., , 2013))</ref>, some endophytes are known to penetrate the leaves of the plant, possibly through stomata <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Compant et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, vertical transmission of endophytes has also been demonstrated by the fact that colonized seeds can be a major source of the plant's endomicrobiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Truyens et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The use of endophytes for disease biocontrol has been postulated in diverse symbiosystems and the effectiveness of endophytes for plant protection and plant growth promotion has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mercado-Blanco and Lugtenberg, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, the transmission to plants of beneficial bacteria by insects is still poorly understood.</s><s>Evidence suggests the transmission of endosymbionts of S. titanus (namely Asaia sp. and Cardinium sp.) through feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gonella et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These microorganisms can also be transferred from insect to insect by the venereal route, during copulation and then from insect to plant by feeding.</s><s>Whether or not these symbionts can survive as endophytes of plants is still unclear.</s><s>In addition, reports show the horizontal transmission of a common bacterial endophyte, Methylobacterium mesophilicum, to Catharanthus roseus plants through the leafhopper Bucephalogonia xanthophis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gai et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In this work, the bacterium isolated as an endophyte from citrus plants was transformed with an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP)-encoding plasmid, and then transference experiments were set up where the bacterium was tracked with the eGFP signal inside the plants and in the insect.</s></p><p><s>The transmission of endophytes by insects is a promising subject of study, not only because it may allow the reconstruction of an important step in their ecology, but also because it may enable the efficient delivery of beneficial microorganisms to crops.</s><s>For this reason, the aim of this work was to assess the transmission by S. titanus of the endophytic bacterial community from grapevine plants naturally colonized by endophytes to micropropagated, bacteria-free grapevine plantlets.</s><s>Using 454 sequencing and qPCR assisted tracking of endophytes, the structure of the endophytic bacterial community was elucidated.</s><s>In addition, the role of S. titanus as vector of bacterial endophytic communities was established.</s><s>Moreover, the effect of plant and insect hosts in endophytic community structure revealed interactions in the tri-partite system (source plant, sink plant and insect vector).</s></p></div>

be transferred and eventually acquired by grapevine plants, becoming part of that core microbiota.</s><s>Two of S. titanus most important endosymbionts, namely Cardinium sp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sacchi et al., 2008)</ref> and Asaia sp., have been previously studied.</s><s>These investigations have shown that S. titanus is able to deliver its Cardinium symbionts to artificial media amended with grapevine leaves, suggesting that even bacteria closely associated to IN could be transferred to the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gonella et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, after searching for sequences of those two organisms within the pyrosequencing reads of all samples, we found no corresponding matches (data not shown).</s><s>In addition, when performing endpoint PCR in SNK and IN samples, we did detect Asaia sp. in IN but not in samples of SNK.</s><s>We also did not find Cardinium sp. in any of the samples, showing that endosymbionts are not evenly distributed in insect populations and that, in our case, most likely they were not transferred from IN to SNK.</s></p><p><s>Other transferred groups might have functional roles linked to colonization of SNK, since they could possess strategies that might be essential for correct establishment of the community, e.g., for cell-to-cell communication, as in Agrobacterium sp. and Erwinia sp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Farrand et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hanano et al., 2014)</ref>, siderophore and antimicrobial compound synthesis, as in Stenotrophomonas sp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ryan et al., 2009)</ref>, or nitrogen metabolism (including nitrogen fixation).</s></p><p><s>We detected an overall fluctuation of diversity and species richness across samples.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we show that richness drops following transfer from plant to vector, plausibly as an effect exerted by the host.</s><s>It is wellknown that microbial communities are adapted to very particular micro-environments in the host and this is one of the factors that shape microbiota structure.</s><s>This effect can be seen when comparing microbiotas of non-phylogenetically related hosts, but also in closely related hosts, where the microbiota has a particular community structure.</s><s>Studies have shown through pyrosequencing that different pig breeds harbor differential microbiota structures and that these can be transferred to nonrelated animals, e.g., mice, which in turn will also modify community structure, highlighting the specificity across hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Diao et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>With these results, we have clearly outlined a pattern that shows that diversity is host-dependent.</s><s>We describe this pattern in terms of ecological measurements.</s><s>Greater variance in richness estimators (Chao1 and observed species) denotes variable content of species per sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>In diversity estimators (Shannon-Wiener and Simpson), greater variance represents the non-dominance (equal distribution) of species, while small variances per sample represent dominance (unequal distribution) of a few species in the community.</s><s>These effects can be easily seen in terms of Simpson's diversity estimator, where SRC's microbiota had a higher variance, which decreased as it was acquired by IN.</s><s>In STEMSNK and ROOTSNK, variance of the estimator increased, once again suggesting the non-dominance of particular species.</s><s>When analyzing these fluctuations as a composite, we are observing an "expansion and contraction" phenomenon of the bacterial endophytic community where changing hosts alters the community structure and possibly changes in functional groups.</s><s>From this perspective, species dominance might hint at a bottleneck for specialists (bacteria with restricted enzymatic capabilities) that might be increased and dominate when inhabiting the IN.</s><s>When inhabiting the plant hosts (SRC and SNK), generalists (e.g., bacteria with a wider range of enzymes capable of using resources in the ecosystem) might be more evenly distributed.</s></p><p><s>An explanation of such generalists in the SRC might be their origin.</s><s>These plants originated from a commercial nursery and were grown in a greenhouse.</s><s>Therefore, they are a rich source of inoculum.</s><s>Most probably, they have acquired their endophytic bacterial communities from the soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015)</ref>, which is a reservoir for generalists <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Monard et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, changing from plant to animal host might mean a challenge for the generalists that are unable to produce adequate enzymes for nutrition with the insect's resources resulting in a decrease in abundance.</s><s>Nutrients in the insect host differ from those in the plant, which may also affect the way the community copes during adaptation.</s><s>As an example, matrices in each host differ in composition.</s><s>In plants, phloem is a complex matrix.</s><s>Seventy percent of the carbohydrate content in the phloem of V. vinifera is comprised of sucrose, with lower quantities of glucose and fructose.</s><s>The main amino acids found are glutamine and proline as well as organic substances such as tartaric, malic, and citric acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Glad et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, large molecules like sialic acid, collagen, and chitin are present in the animal tissues, limiting growth of some bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Thomas, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Other factors affecting community structure when switching hosts might be genetic mutations in single alleles of bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Viana et al., 2015)</ref> as well as "a criterion for proximity, " where symbionts spatially distant from target hosts are less capable of changing hosts, thus adapting to this selective pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(van Baarlen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Not only nutritional factors may be involved in altering community structure.</s><s>Niche occupation might be a trigger for competition among bacteria.</s><s>In our experiments, niches in SRC's microbiota may have overlapped with those of IN's microbiota resulting in competitive exclusion.</s><s>This could result in a decrease in the number of species from SRC to IN when abundance of some genera drastically changed from plant to insect (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Among those microorganisms whose abundance decreased, we found plant-and human-associated bacteria that have been previously identified in the microbiome of grapevine <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yousaf et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>We believe that these bacteria might behave as drivers of diversity with roles in directing community structure during host colonization, given the specificity of their change in abundance and because they harbor genetic determinants that make them good competitors.</s><s>Other such drivers are present in two cases: (i) those whose abundance increased after being transferred from IN to SNK and (ii) those whose abundance increased from STEMSNK to ROOTSNK.</s><s>In the first case (IN to SNK), Ralstonia, Propionibacterium, Burkholderia, and Staphylococcus were the genera whose abundance most drastically changed.</s><s>These organisms have different functions related to colonization pioneering.</s><s>For example, the genera Ralstonia and Burkholderia have a great adaptability for host selection and a wide range of mechanisms for colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Compant et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Genin, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Both genera include plant pathogens as well as symbionts, reflecting genome plasticity.</s><s>Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus are symbionts that have co-evolved with humans and are rich in enzymatic activities.</s><s>These enzymes could be involved in the selection of other microbes that become part of the endophytic community to be transferred or in the conditioning of the micro-habitat before colonization by other microbes.</s></p><p><s>In the second case (transfer from STEMSNK to ROOTSNK), Haemophilus, Paracoccus, Rhodococcus, and Micrococcus were differentially represented in the community of stems and roots.</s><s>A possible explanation of this shift may have a nutritional basis.</s><s>Root exudates may have a strong influence on the assemblage of microbial communities in the rhizosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shi et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>For example, root exudates of rice plants grown under hydroponic conditions contain large amounts of carbohydrates and amino acids that play a role as chemoattractants for endophytic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bacilio-Jimenez et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Rhizodeposition, the process of exudate production and microenvironment enrichment driven by root cap cell deposition, is important in luring bacteria to the endosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bulgarelli et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In grapevine, the effect of root exudates on colonization by endophytes is not wellestablished, however we speculate that root exudates do influence root microbiota, helping differentiate the communities in the STEMSNK and ROOTSNK.</s><s>Root exudates can diffuse out to the rhizosphere and into the plant and thus have an effect on patterns of microbial colonization of the root, even from the inside.</s></p><p><s>As opposed to the SRC, SNK and IN, CTRLSTEM, CTRLROOT, and CTRLIN clearly differed in terms of community composition, where Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were completely dominant (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Only few of the transferred endophytes found in SRC, SNK, and IN were found in the controls.</s></p><p><s>We have also shown a distinction between the insect's microbiota and the plant's endophytic community and propose differentiation according to the host (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Shifts in the bacterial community are associated with a gradient where some of the taxonomical groups have more weight during transmission than the others (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Such a differentiation suggests that some taxa are more proliferous in particular hosts.</s><s>This is of extreme importance in terms of possible endophytic microbiota manipulation by engineering.</s><s>If some of the endophytes (for example those assigned to Bacteroidetes in IN or Acidobacteria in SRC) can grow better in certain types of hosts, we might drive our efforts to enrich and improve these groups in those hosts and experiment to further analyze their plant protection properties for use in agriculture.</s></p><p><s>With our experiments, we can also predict that those groups that acquire greater importance in particular hosts might also be safe to apply in crops of economic value, since they behave as native microbiota.</s></p><p><s>We also highlight the selectivity of the insect as a vector of endophytes.</s><s>Our qPCR experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) suggest that endophytes like E. ludwigii EnVs2 and Enterobacter sp.</s><s>LecVs2 are effectively vectored by the insect from an exogenous source.</s><s>However, for endophyte P. vagans PaVv9, the transmission was inefficient.</s><s>It is possible that only few members of the endophytic community that are acquired by the insect will survive in this host.</s><s>This kind of selectivity has been observed in pathogens of grapevine.</s><s>For example, S. titanus is able to transfer the FDP more efficiently than any other leafhopper vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chuche and Thiéry, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This, together with the high grapevine specificity could make S. titanus an ideal candidate for endophytic delivery in future therapeutic applications in the vineyards.</s></p><p><s>Being isolated from healthy plants, we speculate that the transferred symbionts have a mutualistic association with grapevine.</s><s>Previous studies showed that grapevine endophytes benefit the plant by stimulating growth and protecting it from incoming pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campisano et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, genomic studies of selected endophytic strains from grapevine revealed their potential as plant protection agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lòpez-Fernàndez et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In those studies, strains E. ludwigii EnVs6, P. vagans PaVv9, and E. ludwigii LecVs2 acted as good plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents and had interesting genomic traits for bioprospecting.</s><s>In the present study these strains were used to prove that they are transferred by S. titanus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Results from these experiments suggest that members that are actively transmitted by the insect can possess beneficial properties for the plant.</s><s>Although it may not be the case for all members in the transferred endophytic community, we believe that the endomicrobiome is populated with mutualists that provide the plant with fitness and ecological advantages.</s><s>Moreover, as we have seen in our experiments, beneficial endophytes might be selectively transferred by the insect, hinting at the possibility of insect mediated community shaping.</s></p><p><s>Studying the transmission of the bacterial endophytic communities in economically relevant crops such as grapevine could revolutionize the approaches through which we have dealt with plant disease in the past.</s><s>In addition, by depicting the structure of the bacterial communities of endophytes that can be transferred, it is possible to identify recalcitrant microbes, drivers of diversity and markers that should be further studied from a metabolic point of view.</s><s>Vectoring of beneficial bacteria is an important issue for agricultural research, and possibly comparable to the transmission of pathogens in other systems, e.g., as in humans.</s><s>However, to our knowledge, few works have tried to disentangle the events that occur during the transmission of such beneficial microbes.</s><s>Moreover, the amount of experimental evidence supporting the enrichment of beneficial microbes in agricultural systems, where they actually have an impact on a larger scale is negligible.</s><s>With our work, we have provided more evidence for the vector-assisted transmission of endophytes and propose further investigation where microbiota engineering and wider transmission experiments should be done in order to understand if beneficial microbes could support or even replace the use of other methods for plant protection, including genetic modifications in plants or employment of chemical pesticides.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1
