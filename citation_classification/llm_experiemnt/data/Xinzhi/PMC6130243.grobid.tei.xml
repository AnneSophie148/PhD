<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>dIscussIon and conclusIons</head><p><s>Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> reported that the number of salivary sheaths/tracks of D. citri in citrus (Calamondin) leaves started declining 7 days postfeeding by the psyllids and that branched sheaths declined faster than nonbranched ones, whereas the number of stubby unbranched sheaths actually increased 7 days postfeeding.</s><s>Although these results are difficult to reconcile (especially the increase in the number of stubby sheaths postfeeding), the authors indicated that the persistence of stylet tracks was inversely correlated with leaf maturity and suggested that D. citri sheaths were being dissolved by plant sap enzymes.</s><s>Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> also speculated that stylet tracks would disappear as rapidly in tissues of other host plants of D. citri.</s><s>Using epifluorescence microscopy of cross sections in citron leaves, we showed here that the salivary sheaths of D. citri in these leaves only start showing signs of degradation 3-4 weeks postfeeding of the psyllids that apparently complete degradation takes place in 5-6 weeks, which was true in both healthy and CLas-infected leaves.</s><s>This time range is more consistent with previous reports that salivary sheaths of the beet leafhopper persisted for 20-30 days, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> whereas the much thicker sheaths of the larger glassy-winged sharpshooter leafhopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> persisted up to 80 days postdeposition by these insects into the host plant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref></s><s> further showed that degradation of D. citri salivary sheaths starts at the flange and continues gradually inward and that the inner parts of the sheaths in or near the phloem were still apparently intact 5-6 weeks postdeposition by the psyllids.</s><s>Since these sheaths are mostly intercellular within the mesophyll tissues and mostly intracellular in the phloem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> it is possible that they are being degraded by modifying enzymes from the extracellular matrix in the mesophyll tissue.</s></p><p><s>We also showed that our results are not due to "fading" of the autofluorescence of the salivary sheaths with time, since D. citri sheaths deposited through membranes did not fade up to 7 weeks following their deposition by the psyllids [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>].</s><s>However, we cannot exclude the possibility of interaction with extracellular matrix that could be quenching the autofluorescence of these salivary sheaths with time.</s><s>However, this seem unlikely since Yang et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> using light microscopy techniques (without autofluorescence), reported that D. citri salivary sheaths start dissipating 2 weeks earlier than what our results are showing here (1 week vs. 3 weeks).</s></p><p><s>Finally, we show that degradation of these salivary sheaths was not associated with fungi or bacterial accumulations, which suggests that it might be due to enzymatic activities in the leaf d c b f a e</s></p><p><s>tissues of host plants, especially in the mesophyll.</s><s>The primary structure of hemipteran stylet sheaths was recently reported to consist of highly branched glucose polysaccharides apparently held together by proteins that can be rapidly degraded by specific digestive enzymes that reduce the structured sheaths to a liquid-like substance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref></s><s>Our results in comparison with previous reports

hemipteran salivary sheaths might be variable depending on the insect species, on host plant species, maturity, and other physiological conditions, as well as on various environmental conditions.</s><s>These factors must be taken into consideration if the salivary sheaths/tracks will be used to study feeding behavior, host preference, or host resistance for hemipteran
