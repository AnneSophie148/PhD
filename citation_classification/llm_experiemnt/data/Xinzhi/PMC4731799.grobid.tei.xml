or derive in sufficient amounts from its exclusive diet of the plant phloem sap.</s><s>On the other hand, aphids provide the symbiont with the non-essential amino acids and core metabolites that the

ovarioles.</s><s>This mode of reproduction has a considerable impact on the symbiosis topology in aphids, for instance with the existence of two distinct symbiotic compartments: the maternal bacteriocytes and those contained in the developing embryos.</s><s>To ensure the sustainability of the symbiotic association, a limited number of symbionts are vertically transmitted from a single

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of B. aphidicola endosymbionts using flow cytometry.</head><p><s>Despite the extensive use of flow cytometry for cell counting in biological applications, no previous studies have used this technique to quantify endosymbionts in symbiotic insects.</s><s>We have adapted flow cytometry to the aphid model, using an aphid clone housing the B. aphidicola endosymbiont and deprived of all other secondary symbionts described in aphid populations (see the Methods section).</s><s>To develop this novel approach, we took into account the specificity of aphid symbiosis, in which symbiotic bacteria are localized in specific insect cells, the bacteriocytes, which need to be isolated from other aphid tissues.</s><s>Consequently, to adapt flow cytometry protocols for aphids, we developed a two-step procedure: (i) bacteriocytes were isolated by dissection from fresh aphid tissues and (ii) symbionts were extracted from isolated bacteriocytes by filtration, thereby excluding the presence of eukaryotic cells (on average ten times bigger than B. aphidicola cells).</s><s>Endosymbiont suspensions were then analyzed by flow cytometry, using an adapted sequential gating procedure.</s><s>To discriminate endosymbiont cells from electronic background noise and debris, we selected the events positively labeled with the SYTO9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), after confirming that the buffer used to resuspend cells did not generate any misleading signals.</s><s>The SYTO9 dye, frequently used for bacterial viability analyses, was shown to be well suited for flow cytometry applications in prokaryotic organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> .</s><s>It has the advantage of permeating viable cells without requiring repeated washing steps, which result in considerable loss of cells and often interfere with data repeatability and reliability.</s><s>The SYTO9-positive population, representing 99.7% of total events (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), was then sequentially analyzed following size (FSC-W/FSC-H;

from electronic background noise and debris, two important confounding elements frequently encountered when flow cytometry is used to detect cells in low concentration samples.</s><s>We attribute this to the optimized extraction procedure, which limits the presence of aphid cellular fragments, and the flow cytometry settings developed through this study, which avoid misleading signals, with less than 1.5% of the total events being SYTO9-negative.</s><s>This protocol enabled us to measure samples containing only ten aphids, thus opening the way to establishing, in the future, large-scale

decrease in endosymbiont number, as we observed in embryonic chains during aphid aging.</s><s>Interestingly, the few symbionts that we have counted in the embryonic chains of senescent aphids were due

increase in both the B. aphidicola and the bacteriocyte numbers was observed during nymphal development, peaking at the onset of the adult stage.</s><s>During this period, the bacteriocytes increase not only in number but also in size, clustering in two regular structures inside the aphid abdomen.</s><s>Since the growth rate of the endosymbiont population (r = 0.85 day -1 , Fig. <ref

degenerates and the number of bacteriocytes and primary endosymbionts progressively decreases as the aphid ages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>We interpret this as a correlation of a decreasing metabolic demand and of the disproportionate cost of maintaining a large endosymbiont population.</s><s>Thus, the degeneration of the symbiotic structures may enable a

of the bacteriocytes and the endosymbionts they contain, but only a decline until a certain level, presumably that which is necessary for aphid survival.</s><s>This age-dependent degeneration of symbiotic structures is even more pronounced in other insects.</s><s>In carpenter ants only very few, if any, somatic bacteriocytes have been detected in old workers ants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>More dramatically, a total and rapid atrophy of somatic bacteriomes, associated with a complete elimination of the endosymbiotic population, has been observed in Sitophilus weevils rapidly after the adult emergence and cuticle synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>By contrast to weevil symbiosis, where insects recycle endosymbionts when any benefits have expired, the maintenance of symbionts (and bacteriocytes) in old aphids reflects the high level of Buchnera integration in the physiology of their hosts.</s><s>The long co-evolutionary history of aphids with B. aphidicola renders these bacteria profitable throughout the insect cycle, with their numbers being fine-tuned as a function of physiological demand.</s></p><p><s>The significant endosymbiont decrease in line with aphid aging is likely the result of two factors that can directly impact the symbiotic load.</s><s>First, given that the histological analysis shows bacteriocyte structure degradation, we propose autophagy as a possible mechanism.</s><s>Indeed, autophagy was recently demonstrated as regulating the proliferation of the parasitic reproductive endosymbionts Wolbachia spp., in Drosophila and filarial nematodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , or the Sodalis pierantonius endosymbiont load, in weevils <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Secondly, in parallel with the reduction in the bacteriocyte size, we have also observed a decrease in B. aphidicola density in these cells.</s><s>This phenomenon takes place after the final ecdysis, the developmental phase in which the lysosomal system in aphid bacteriocytes has been shown to trigger symbiont degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Further cellular and molecular studies are needed to examine the precise involvement of cell death processes in the regulation of symbiont number in the aphid model.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study sheds new light onto how symbiotic cells numbers, and bacteriocyte sizes and localization vary in response to host developmental needs within a nutritional insect symbiosis.</s><s>Our results reveal a coordinated dynamics between the host cells, the bacteriocytes, and the primary endosymbionts they contain, providing a step-by-step picture from parthenogenetic embryos to the senescent adults.</s><s>They highlight the need for identification of the cellular and molecular processes regulating these dynamics during the insect's physiological development, as well as under stress conditions.</s><s>The flow cytometry analysis developed in this study provides a promising approach for subsequent work on other symbiotic models,
