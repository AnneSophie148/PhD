<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Gene drive is a novel genetic engineering tool for controlling disease transmitting vectors and agricultural pests.</s><s>Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive has broad application prospects due to its high specificity and flexibility.</s><s>It functions by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure their widespread transmission across successive generations.</s><s>Current CRISPR-based gene drives consist of three key components: a Cas9 endonuclease gene, one or multiple gRNAs, and a marker gene.</s><s>Once the target site on a homologous chromosome is cleaved, the gene-drive element is inserted into the double-stranded break (DSB) through homology-directed repair (HDR), utilizing the drive-bearing homologous chromosome as a template for repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>If this process of directional gene conversion, also known as homing, is highly efficient, the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns (&gt;50%).</s><s>Under ideal conditions, the gene drive elements will eventually spread throughout the population.</s><s>In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes engineered with CRISPRbased gene-drive have achieved close to 100% inheritance of the desired allele across successive generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, the emergence of resistance alleles through end-joining can inhibit the drive, blocking recognition by the gRNAs and potentially maintaining gene function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that in this research we use the term "resistance" broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair, causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive.</s><s>In some lab experiments, resistance to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing drives arise rapidly, especially when using a single gRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation, including in-frame indels, would incur substantial fitness costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Because the drive itself causes recessive female sterility, another important technical aspect of this approach is how to keep large-scale rearing for area-wide releases with a homing suppression element that would otherwise crash due to female sterility.</s></p><p><s>Intriguingly, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have unveiled the potential of a specific target gene, tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2).</s><s>This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of octopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including egg laying <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>A single point mutation in the active site of Tdc2, disrupting the production of octopamine in the nervous system, results in female sterility due to impaired oviductal contractions and egg retention in homozygous females, while heterozygotes are normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>More importantly, this characteristic can be restored through octopamine feeding, indicating that Tdc2 is a potential target for gene drives and enabling conditional rescue of the homozygous drive phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Drosophila suzukii, also known as spotted wing drosophila (SWD), is a major agricultural pest.</s><s>Female SWD have specialized serrated ovipositors, which can lay eggs directly into ripe fruits with soft skins such as strawberries and grapes.</s><s>The sterile insect technique (SIT) has been successfully employed for the widespread suppression of pests, including SWD, by releasing a substantial excess of sterile males in a repeated manner at a ratio of at least 10:1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the high costs of implementing SIT over large areas, genetic suppression through gene drive technology may be a more favorable option for controlling SWD populations.</s><s>Targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene, a recently created CRISPR/Cas9-based split gene drive (sGD) system in SWD showed 94-99% transmission rates with a line that expressed Cas9 with two nuclear localization sequences from the D. suzukii nanos promoter.</s><s>It was effective at population suppression in mathematical simulations with continuous releases of more modest size (1:4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study reports the development of a novel CRISPR-based homing gene drive system targeting the Tdc2 gene with the previously untested vasa promoter in SWD.</s><s>We demonstrated conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype by feeding octopamine and showed moderate levels of gene drive efficiency that specifically target the Tdc2 locus.</s><s>We also conducted additional experiments in D. melanogaster to further characterize this drive system.</s><s>These findings suggest potential applications of Tdc2-targeting gene drives for SWD population management, paving the way for more effective and sustainable pest control strategies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A homing gene drive system targeting Tdc2 in SWD</head><p><s>We first analyzed the genomic structure of SWD Tdc2 locus and selected three gRNAs with spacing between them ranging from 50-150 bp to decrease functional resistance generation and possibly improve drive efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (Fig <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>Next, we identified and synthesized the SWD vasa promoter for efficient germline expression of SpCas9 (S1A Fig) .</s><s>Homing-based suppression requires high rates of homing and low maternal carryover cleavage to prevent fitness costs and the appearance of a high frequency of NHEJ resistant alleles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>While the vasa promoter is known to have high levels of somatic expression in D. melanogaster and mosquitoes, it has not been tested in SWD.</s><s>According to the D. melanogaster vasa promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the sequence information in vasa-Cas9 transgenic flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we found that the commonly used D. melanogaster vasa promoter uses the 5' UTR region in both the first and second exons, up to the start codon on the latter and excluding the intron.</s><s>In contrast, the start codon of SWD vasa is on the fourth exon.</s><s>Therefore, the 5´UTR region (112bp) on the first exon, 5´UTR region (19bp) on the fourth exon and 5´upstream sequences (1292bp) before the first exon of SWD vasa were selected as the vasa promoter region (S1B Fig) .</s><s>Finally, a donor plasmid containing left and right homologous arms, tRNA-gRNAs driven by the D. melanogaster U6:3 promoter, SpCas9 endonuclease with its vasa promoter sequence, and DsRed marker expressed through the whole body under the control of the D. melanogaster PUb promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> was constructed to fulfill our gene drive system (Fig <ref type="figure">1B)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>After microinjection and primary outcross with wild-type (WT) SWD, flies that showed red fluorescence in the body were selected and named as DsTdc2 CRISPR (Fig <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>PCR amplification from genomic DNA using diagnostic primers that indicate correct transgene integration in the Tdc2 locus was performed to confirm that the gene drive element was inserted in the target locus (Fig <ref type="figure">1D</ref>).</s><s>The successful acquisition of mutants through microinjection showed that the SWD vasa promoter is functional in expressing Cas9, as observed from the outcomes when only the donor plasmid was injected without any additional Cas9 protein.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our research demonstrated the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct fGD systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both the agricultural pest SWD and the model insect D. melanogaster.</s><s>The gene drive study on SWD, an economic pest, is highly meaningful.</s><s>Currently, many researchers are gradually shifting their focus from model organisms to application species and back for further exploration.</s></p><p><s>However, the fGD system implemented in SWD did not exhibit high super-mendelian homing efficiency, so it could not spread through the population in cage trials.</s><s>Three factors might have contributed to this outcome.</s><s>First, sequence polymorphism in gene drive modified organisms can greatly influence the efficacy of gene drive element spread in the population and thus may have negatively affected our drive <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Second, the efficiency of the Cas9 and/or gRNA expression system may have been low, perhaps due to position effects that neighboring genetic elements surrounding the transgene insertion site suppress Cas9 expression.</s><s>Third, the fitness cost of the drive was moderate, too high to be overcome by the low drive efficiency.</s><s>In D. melanogaster, we initially employed two Cas9 promoters that had previously shown good expression, but this did not improve homing efficiency.</s><s>However, introducing Cas9 protein from another genomic source greatly increased the efficiency of the gene drive system, indicating that position effects may partially account for our SWD results.</s></p><p><s>Using gene drive to manage invasive pest SWD is a promising and innovative approach, but as a species with a high level of genetic polymorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, such genetic background may have a significant impact on the effective spread of gene drive through populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>In a Medea gene drive system of SWD <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the genetic diversity of the population led to the emergence of antitoxin mutants in cage experiments, thus limiting the spread of the drive.</s><s>The results in our study also showed that the homing rate of gene drive alleles could potentially be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the gRNA targeting sites and homology regions.</s></p><p><s>A recent study showed high efficiency with the SWD nanos promoter driving expression of Cas9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In our system, the vasa promoter (which has usually given similar germline performance to nanos in D. melanogaster) element was perhaps missing too much of the middle portion of the 5' UTR to retain normal expression levels.</s><s>It is possible that including the full 5' UTR would have increased activity.</s><s>However, a single injection of donor plasmid containing gRNAs and our vasa-Cas9 into the embryo of SWD achieved successful genome editing, which showed, together with some drive activity, that our vasa promoter was functional in this system.</s><s>Other homologs of promoters from D. melanogaster could potentially allow for more efficient suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our measured fitness cost of 47% in drive heterozygous females in the cage experiment was in line with that found in several other suppression drives <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>This could come from drive-based disruption of wild-type alleles due to widespread somatic Cas9 expression facilitated by the vasa promoter.</s><s>While the fecundity of heterozygous females in our individual crosses was not apparently different from wild-type, this may not be the case in population cages <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which might be more vulnerable to changes of food condition, population density, peer competition for resources, etc.</s><s>It is also possible that the observed fitness costs manifest in other ways, such as affecting egg viability (rather than fecundity), or even affecting the mating success of males.</s></p><p><s>Unlike D. melanogaster, the female SWD Tdc2 null mutants are still able to lay small numbers of viable eggs, and we did not explore the reason for this.</s><s>We suspect that the insertion of a large gene drive cassette in the Tdc2 locus might impact neighboring Tdc1 expression and partially rescue the Tdc2 phenotype, potentially allowing the issue to be solved with drive design adjustments such as reversing the orientation of some genes within the drive.</s><s>Another plausible explanation is that the function of Tdc2 is not fully conserved between these two fly species, implying that SWD Tdc2 might not be an optimal target gene due to the observed incomplete sterility.</s></p><p><s>As gene drive elements propagate throughout the population, they can trigger the emergence of resistance alleles due to the end-joining repair, thereby impacting the efficiency of the gene drive.</s><s>Nonfunctional resistance alleles can impede the spread of the gene drive, especially if they arise from maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNAs.</s><s>The presence of functional resistance alleles would have an even more significant impact.</s><s>Comprehensive studies have shown that simultaneous targeting with several gRNAs improves cleavage efficiency and reduces resistance alleles in cage trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>To mitigate the formation of functional resistance alleles, we employed three gRNAs to target the Tdc2 gene, inducing nonfunctional mutations at the desired sites.</s><s>This design likely reduced the selective pressure for resistance by minimizing the formation rate of functional resistance alleles.</s></p><p><s>The key characteristic of our gene drive systems is that the phenotype of female sterility can be rescued by feeding of octopamine, which is inexpensive.</s><s>In certain gene drive systems that aim to induce female infertility by targeting haplosufficient genes, it is impossible to reverse the infertility phenotype in drive homozygous females <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, introduction of wildtype females into the gene drive transgenic population continuously is necessary to maintain the population.</s><s>In our design, feeding octopamine to female flies can successfully restore their egg-laying defects.</s><s>This may facilitate large-scale breeding of gene drive flies and contribute to commercial production <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, reducing costs, implying rearing, and potentially even allowing mass-rearing strategies and continuous releases that require reduced drive performance for successful suppression.</s></p></div>
