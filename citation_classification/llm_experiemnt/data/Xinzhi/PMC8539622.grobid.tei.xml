<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Aquaporins (AQPs), as the name denotes, are specialized integral membrane proteins that form pores through which water and small neutral molecules are selectively channeled across cellular membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Ubiquitous in nature, AQPs belong to a large class of proteins called major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) and play critical roles in osmoregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>AQPs have garnered great interest and have been intensively studied since the first description of aquaporin from red blood cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Two regions are distinctive of the family of AQPs: the NPA-region (Asn-Pro-Ala), found in the middle of the channel, and the aromatic-arginine (ar/R) region located on the extracellular side of the cell membrane.</s><s>The NPA-region is substrate permeable and consists of two Asn-Pro-Ala motifs embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane channel <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>The Ar/R-region serves as a selectivity filter for water and neutral solutes, facilitating water transport by restricting larger molecules from entering the channel from the extracellular sides of the membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>AQPs have been classified into three subfamilies: the orthodox or traditional water-selective aquaporins (AQP0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8); glycerol-transporting aquaglyceroporins (GLPs), which may also transport small non-charged solutes like urea and metalloids (AQP3, 7, 9 and 10); and unorthodox or super aquaporins (AQP11 and 12), which contain 1 NPA motif and one variant motif and are found only in animal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The AQPs form water channels through the plasma membrane of the cell in order to passively transport water in response to osmotic gradients, and they have an important role in cell volume regulation and excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically in insects, the AQPs are indispensable for cellular water regulation, and their presence is an adaptation to survive in extreme environmental conditions such as subzero temperatures and drought.</s><s>In these cases, water removal from cells is critical to initiating diapause or hibernation and for avoiding damage from ice crystal formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>Other insects need the AQPs to cope with diets consisting of excess liquids such as blood or plant saps (phloem and xylem) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Insects belonging to the order Hemiptera ingest large quantities of plant sap to acquire sufficient levels of nitrogen and other nutrients.</s><s>Plant sap contains primarily water and sugars as main components, which provoke the increase of osmotic pressure in the insect gut.</s><s>In order to overcome this challenge, the insects quickly break down sucrose into fructose and glucose, which are transported to the interior of the cells, and the remaining sugars in the gut are oligomerized and eliminated as honeydew <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Aquaporin water channels in the gut of many insects may serve as the first opportunity to reduce the osmotic pressure induced by phloem feeding by allowing water to pass through the plasma membranes from the hemolymph into the gut lumen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>The survival of D. citri and other hemipterans depends on their ability to osmoregulate after feeding on plant phloem sap, which is known for its rich sucrose content, but such feeding may increase the osmotic pressure up to 4-5 times <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, Douglas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> noted "phloem-feeding insects are expected to shrivel as they feed" if not for the ability to reduce their osmotic pressure.</s><s>The primary mechanism for maintaining osmotic pressure in D. citri is by sucrose hydrolase activity in the gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Other works have identified and characterized AQP activity as a secondary mechanism that facilitates the osmotic movement of water from the distal gut to the proximal midgut (stomach) and promotes pressure equilibrium between the gut lumen and the hemolymph.</s><s>The works with Bemisia tabaci and Acyrthosiphon pisum mentioned that the silencing of AQP1 provoked disruption of osmoregulation due to a significant elevation in the osmotic pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Some Hemipterans such as leafhoppers, froghoppers, whiteflies, and psyllids have a characteristic water-conducting anatomical complex called the filter chamber that bypasses part of the digestive tract and functions to shunt rapidly and directly large amounts of fluids from the foregut to the midgut <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>This structure, together with the AQPs, participates in water cycling in the alimentary tracks of sap-feeders and helps to alleviate osmotic pressure.</s><s>In fact, the AQPs are localized in the filter chamber of Cicadela viridis and in the anterior ileum of the hindgut of B. tabaci <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> where they act to remove excess dietary water <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In other phloem-feeding insects such as aphids that lack a filter chamber, the close proximity between the distal and proximal regions of the gut facilitates water transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>AQP1 was immunolocalized in the distal intestine, and its probable function most likely relates to shunting water to the stomach to relieve osmotic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Owing to their high specificity, RNA interference (RNAi) techniques to silence genes have been widely accepted as an alternative method to control insect pests of importance to human health and agriculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, AQPs present a worthy target for insect pest management through RNAi technology.</s><s>The silencing of ClAQP in the human bed bug Cimex lectularius, which transmits Trypanosoma cruzi, severely affects its excretion, water homeostasis and reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The fitness of the tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, which transmits the protozoan Babesia bovis, was decreased by silencing of RmAQP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In the pea aphid, the silencing of ApAQP1 caused significant elevation in osmotic pressure of the hemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, in the potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli, Ibanez, Hancock and Tamborindeguy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that AQPs play a role in sustaining the primary endosymbiont and, consequently, could be a valuable target for studying this interaction.</s></p><p><s>Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is one of the most notorious agricultural pests because it transmits and spreads the bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' that causes huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>HLB disease is devastating for the citrus industry, and the immediate solution to controlling transmission has been through managing the vector, D. citri.</s><s>However, despite efforts to reduce the population of insects with insecticides and biological controls, these measures have not been sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>In D. citri, RNAi techniques have proven to be a powerful tool to assess the efficacy of genes targeted to reduce psyllid survival and fecundity, increase susceptibility to insecticides, increase mortality, cause abnormal conditions, or interfere with homeostasis <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>AQP is one of three mechanisms insects use to regulate osmotic pressure.</s><s>In addition to AQP, sucrose hydrolase acts to break down sucrose into fructose and glucose, while sucrose transglucosidase oligomerizes glucose into long-chain oligosaccharides, primarily trehalose, which is excreted as honeydew <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>These three mechanisms act together to reduce high osmotic pressure caused by the ingestion of a liquid diet high in sucrose.</s><s>In our previous work, we silenced sucrose hydrolase (DcSuh) in D. citri using RNAi, which resulted in disruption of the osmotic homeostasis in D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>This led us to investigate other candidate genes related to water balance, such as aquaporins.</s><s>We used the databases to identify the aquaporin gene of D. citri using in silico analysis and silence the AQP gene in D. citri by means of RNAi technique.</s><s>We hypothesize that silencing DcAQP using dsRNA will result in knockdown of its transcript expression, which will cause increased mortality in adults, owing to their inability to maintain internal water homeostasis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>In this first study of silencing aquaporin in D. citri, we found significant increases in the nymph mortality, reduction in body fresh weight and length and increases in the uric acid content associated with RNAi-treated D. citri.</s><s>Some of these effects were transient, as was found in our previous work with CYP4.</s><s>The silencing of DcAQP could have a stronger, more durable effect in the control of D. citri if applied in conjunction with other RNAi gene targets such as DcSuh to further enhance disruption of D. citri osmoregulation.</s><s>Future research efforts in this area should include evaluation of ROS damage, measurements of hemolymph osmotic pressure or water content, and DcAQP localization to specific tissues to further support the functional roles of aquaporin in D. citri.</s><s>In addition, delivery of DcAQP as a plant-incorporated protectant via transgenic citrus or as a field-applied or injected product should be investigated as the current method is limited to laboratory investigations.</s></p></div>
