<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Aphids are insects which respond quickly to environmental changes by developing alternative phenotypes, such as asexual and sexual forms, a phenomenon called polyphenism.</s><s>Asexual clonal forms produced during all spring and summer develop efficient strategies to adapt themselves to fluctuating conditions of their environment.</s><s>Under conditions of reduced food quantity or quality, or when attacked by predators, clonal forms can switch in two generations from wingless to winged forms that easily colonize new host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the production of winged morphs, which are in charge of long range dispersion, clonal forms are able to react in a very short time using alternative escape behaviors for short range dispersion.</s><s>Some aphids indeed leave their host plant and begin to explore their close environment to find fresh resources and to immediately settle new colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> The release of volatile compounds, such as the alarm pheromone secreted by aphids in the presence of predators, also triggers various reactions such as the withdrawal of the stylet from the plant, or the walking or dropping off the host plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This high behavioral plasticity makes them good candidates to explore the molecular basis of such a phenomenon.</s><s>Nevertheless, almost nothing is known of the physiological and genetic mechanisms controlling polyphenism and individual behavior in aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A natural polymorphism in the foraging gene (for), that encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), has been shown to be associated to behavioral plasticity in several insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, larvae and adults of the rover phenotype have larger moving trails in the presence of food compared to sitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Higher levels of for expression and PKG activity are observed in the heads of the rover allelic variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The for gene was then suggested to play a role in the behavioral plasticity in response to food deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In the honeybee Apis mellifera, higher levels of expression of the for gene (Amfor) and PKG activities were detected in foragers compared to nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>A subsequent study evidenced an Amfor expression peak during the period of transition from nurse to forager, and suggested that in normal conditions the honeybee foraging behavior is at least partly due to a trigger-effect of Amfor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The Amfor expression was thus strongly associated with tasks performed outside the hive and suggested to affect the division of labor by modulating phototaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>A differential expression of the for gene homologues has also been reported in other social insects although a negative correlation was initially observed between the PKG activity level and foraging activities.</s><s>In the common wasp Vespula vulgaris, bumblebees and the some red harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex, which all display progression of worker tasks during their lifespan, known as age-related polyethism, lower for mRNA levels were detected in foraging workers than in nest workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, Ingram et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> recently highlighted a more complex expression pattern of the for gene in the harvester ant foragers : for expression changes in the course of the day consistently with the task-specific circadian rhythm observed in this species.</s><s>A similar fluctuation of the for expression level has been observed in honeybee over the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A more precise and systematic study of the for gene expression combined with a meticulous analysis of behavioral traits is likely the best approach to understand the mechanisms by which for modulates the insect behavior.</s></p><p><s>The recent sequencing of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genome and its subsequent automated annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> has provided an appreciable tool to characterize the for gene in a clonal species displaying high behavioral plasticity.</s><s>In this study, we first cloned the cDNAs of the pea aphid foraging gene orthologue Apfor.</s><s>We then analyzed their expression patterns across parthenogenetic developmental stages, morphs and behavioral variants.</s><s>We also explored whether environmental conditions (low and high population densities, which determine food resources availability) may impact Apfor expression.</s><s>Our experiments showed that Apfor is highly expressed in key developmental stages and in wingless adults reared under crowded conditions.</s><s>The PKG enzyme activity measured in the behavioral variants corroborates the observed variations of Apfor expression.</s><s>We then suggest that Apfor could possibly act to trigger the shift from sedentary to exploratory behavior.</s><s>Our results lay the groundwork for a more detailed analysis of the implication of Apfor in the behavioral plasticity of the pea aphid.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collection of behavioral variants</head><p><s>Behavioral variants were obtained under two different conditions of population density.</s><s>Wingless viviparous adults (VWL) were recovered under low population density conditions that provide good food quality and large space for female reproduction.</s><s>For that purpose, five females were transferred on a flowerpot and their one day-old adult progeny sucking on the leaves was collected at the same time in the morning.</s><s>The other behavioral variants were obtained under high population density initiated from five females transferred on a flowerpot and left there giving rise to several generations until crowded conditions were achieved.</s><s>Generated winged aphids (VW) were then collected when they were one day-old (low survival without fresh plant).</s><s>In the same time, some wingless adult aphids left the plants, starting to walk and explore their environment (named wingless forager adults VWLf) while others kept feeding on stems or leaves (named wingless sedentary crowded adults VWLc).</s><s>VWLf and VWLc were collected at the same time about 3 hours after the first individuals started walking on the cage walls, which could be whenever in the daytime.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Acyrthosiphon pisum foraging gene</head><p><s>To isolate A. pisum for cDNAs, we designed primers from an A. pisum EST fragment available on the Aphidbase 1.0 database that showed unambiguous homology with the Drosophila melanogaster for gene.</s><s>3' and 5' RACE experiments resulted in the cloning of two full-length cDNA sequences we named Apfor1 (GeneBank accession number JN812212) and Apfor2 (GeneBank accession number JN812213).</s><s>Thanks to the recent sequencing of the pea aphid genome, we managed to locate these two complete A. pisum for cDNAs on a genomic scaffold (Scaffold409, GeneBank accession number GL350029) and subsequently deduced that they are composed of 16 exons, exons 3 to 16 being common to Apfor1 and Apfor2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The full size of the Apfor genomic sequence is difficult to determine because of the large size of some introns (notably intron 3 covering more than 300 kb) and of residual sequencing errors.</s><s>In agreement with genome sequence data, a Southern blot analysis clearly showed that only one gene homologous to for is present in the A. pisum genome (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> shows the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the two complete cDNAs.</s><s>These sequences are 3420 and 3338 bp long respectively, and contain an ORF of 2331 bp for Apfor1 and 2112 pb for Apfor2.</s><s>They differ only in their 5' region (the first two exons) and perfectly overlap for their following 2462 bp (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), as a result of alternative splicing.</s><s>Exons 1 and 2 of Apfor2 are indeed located in the intron 2 of the Apfor gene suggesting that these exons are spliced in the Apfor1 variant.</s><s>Both Apfor1 and Apfor2 sequences are about 56% identical at the nucleotide level and 70% similar at the amino acid level to the for gene sequence of D. melanogaster.</s><s>Analysis of the two deduced amino acid sequences reveals typical structures of a cGMPdependent protein kinase including a N-terminal region containing a regulatory compartment (a dimerization domain with a leucine zipper motif, autophosphorylation sites and an autoinhibitory domain), two tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding domains and a serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain as determined by PROSITE at SIB ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal (<ref type="url" target="http://prosite.expasy.org">http://prosite.expasy.org</ref>).</s><s>Despite their differences in the 5' region, both transcripts encode putatively complete and active PKG proteins suggesting they are two functional alternative splicing variants of the same gene.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative expression of Apfor among behavioral variants of pea aphid adults</head><p><s>Under crowded conditions, different behavioral variants are observed in wingless adults, in addition to the typical production of winged morphs able to disseminate over a long distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, some wingless aphids keep on feeding on the phloem sap under the leaves or on the stems (variants VWLc) while others leave the plant, walk and forage their environment to find better conditions for feeding and producing offspring (variants VWLf).</s><s>We thus analyzed the level of both Apfor transcripts in four categories of behavioral adult variants, three reared under high population density (winged adults VW, wingless sedentary crowded adults VWLc and wingless forager adults VWLf) and one reared under low population density (wingless sedentary adults VWL) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>The expression of the Apfor1 transcript is significantly higher in the VWLc variants compared to other variants (one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD test; F = 8,71, P,0,001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Apfor2 transcripts are also significantly more expressed in the VWLc variant (F = 4,08, P,0,05) but we observe the same trend in the VWLf variant.</s><s>A higher standard error value is observed for both variants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>These results confirm our previous observations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) that no significant difference occurs in Apfor expression between VW reared under high population density and VWL reared under low population density.</s><s>So, the high expression level of the pea aphid for gene seems to be associated with the exploratory behavior due to crowded conditions rather than with morphological variants.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our results confirm that foraging, an important gene associated with behavioral plasticity in insects, is conserved in Hemiptera.</s><s>We indeed report the cloning and analysis of the transcripts of this gene in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, a particularly interesting species regarding its polyphenism ability combined with behavioral plasticity, allowing rapid adaptation to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as overcrowding or the presence of enemies.</s><s>This short-term adaptive response confers to aphid species their remarkable invasive potential which make them efficient insects pests.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the expression of the pea aphid foraging gene seems as complex as reported in D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> or Caenorhabditis elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> with multiple alternative splicing transcripts.</s><s>The functional A one-way ANOVA followed by a Fisher's PLSD test shows the statistically significant differences between groups denoted by different letters (P,0,05 or P,0,01).</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065104.g002</s><s>significance of the two identified transcripts was not determined but they are full length variants which encode two putative functional proteins.</s><s>These transcripts are produced by a single gene as determined by a Southern blot experiment (data not shown).</s><s>The analysis of sequences from the pea aphid genome reveals a second gene coding for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (GeneBank, accession number XM 001947008), very likely the ortholog to the dg1 gene from D. melanogaster.</s><s>These two aphid genes have diverged enough (41% of similarity) not to crosshybridize using classical Southern blot techniques.</s><s>The pea aphid seems thus as well genetically equipped as D. melanogaster or honeybee to set up behavioral plasticity.</s></p><p><s>In a first step, we tested whether the morphological state (wingless or winged morphs) and the different developmental stages of the viviparous parthenogenetic pea aphids could be associated with a differential Apfor expression.</s><s>The expression patterns of Apfor1 and Apfor2 transcripts are roughly similar, and no significant difference is found between wingless and winged morphs at any developmental stage.</s><s>By contrast, we observe that the 2nd instar and the winged 4th instar larval stages show a significantly higher expression of the two Apfor transcripts than the other stages.</s><s>The L2 stage has previously been shown to be crucial for wings formation.</s><s>Indeed, Ishikawa and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> demonstrated that all first instar larvae (reared under low or high density conditions) possess wing primordia which degenerate during the 2nd instar larvae in the wingless forms only.</s><s>In the winged forms, the wing primordia develop and become thick.</s><s>In the same way, these authors showed that during the 4th instar larval stage the transition of internal structures in wing buds is dramatic: the muscle cells completely proliferate and fuse into syncitial muscle cells.</s><s>Apfor is thus highly expressed at key steps of the larval development involved in wing formation and thus in the flight capacity of the pea aphid.</s></p><p><s>In a second step, we tested the expression of Apfor among the behavioral variants of viviparous parthenogenetic adults which are produced under low population density or crowded environmental conditions.</s><s>Surprisingly, behavioral variants having a significantly higher Apfor expression are wingless aphids feeding on phloem sap from leaves or stems.</s><s>The foragers, which escape to find fresh resources, present only a slight increase of Apfor2 transcripts.</s><s>As our results were obtained using whole aphid body and not only head, which is the control center of the behavior, a direct correlation between Apfor and the aphid behavior could not be inferred.</s><s>Indeed, the for gene has also been shown in Drosophila to  be implicated in other physiological processes such as cristal cells formations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> or modulation of the cardiac rythm in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>We thus performed measurements of the PKG enzyme activity in whole bodies and in heads of the different behavioral variants.</s><s>The results parallel those observed for the Apfor expression, with a significant higher activity in VWLc aphids.</s><s>This reinforces the hypothesis of an existing correlation between Apfor expression and aphid behavior.</s><s>Taken together, our results suggest that Apfor may induce a foraging behavior in some wingless adults under crowded conditions acting as a promoting signal to find better environmental niches in a short delay.</s><s>Foragers would have a weaker Apfor transcript and PKG activity level, maybe as a residual expression after the behavioral switch initiated by Apfor.</s><s>Considering that a stimulus is certainly required to shift from a sedentary to a dispersal behavior, the for gene is a promising candidate to fulfill this role.</s><s>Complementary behavioral experiments are now needed to determine unambiguously whether wingless sedentary adults reared under crowded conditions and presenting an increased Apfor level are those which subsequently forage their environment.</s><s>To our knowledge, the detailed behavior of wingless adult aphids has not been described yet.</s><s>In addition, the exact nature of the stimulus and its molecular targets still have to be identified.</s></p><p><s>In the honeybee A. mellifera, the occurrence of a peak in Amfor expression, rather than a slowly upcoming and continuous high expression level, suggests that the transition from nurses to foragers outside the hive is triggered by Amfor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In the same way, in the harvester ant P. occidentalis a daily fluctuation occurs in the expression of the for ortholog Pofor.</s><s>A peak of mRNA level is observed in foragers at midday <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> while nest workers show lower levels of Pofor mRNA during the day and similar or higher levels in late evening and early morning hours.</s><s>Interestingly, in a related harvester ant P. barbatus, Ingram and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> showed a lower expression of Pbfor in foragers than in workers but the study was limited to the collection of workers at a single time in the day (as we did with pea aphids).</s><s>As the sampled workers were collected in the field in early morning, it cannot be excluded that the Pbfor expression fluctuates in a similar pattern as Pofor in the daytime.</s><s>In laboratory conditions, the population density of pea aphids had to be very high with confluent adults to simultaneously allow the production of winged morphs and wingless behavioral variants.</s><s>As a consequence, it was very difficult to collect synchronous individuals for all qPCR replicates, which might thus explain the high range of standard errors for our experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>As in the harvester ants, the Apfor gene might be highly expressed at a specific time in the day or in the life cycle of only part of pea aphid wingless individuals, in response to an external stimulus triggering their foraging behavior.</s><s>Complementary experiments are needed to determine the timing of Apfor expression in wingless pea aphids under crowded conditions, and to question whether all individuals or only some of them differentially express Apfor in order to establish a specific relationship between this gene and behavior plasticity.</s><s>As in other species, the nature of the interacting stimuli and their molecular targets remain also to be determined.</s><s>In nematodes, odors and pheromones act to stimulate and regulate the expression of the for ortholog Egl-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, Ppa-egl-4 is directly implicated in the attraction to the pheromone emitted by its insect host <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Could the pea aphid alarm pheromone, which mediates the production of winged dispersal morphs, also regulate Apfor expression?</s><s>In this case, a new role in chemo-attraction or olfaction could be assigned to for in insects alike to its role in nematodes.</s></p><p><s>As in social insects whose task behaviors appear to be associated with the regulation of the for gene expression, the fluctuations of Apfor expression in pea aphids seems to be associated with feedingbehavior plasticity.</s><s>This would establish a link between the for gene and the plasticity of the feeding behavior across the insect class.</s><s>In parthenogenetic insects like aphids, among which some species reproduce only as clonal forms, the existence of such genes contributing to adaptation to environmental stresses is very important to compensate for the lack of the genetic variability produced by mating.</s><s>These genes may allow aphids to reduce the delay in response to harmful biotic (poor quality of food resources, presence of natural enemies) and abiotic factors (pollutants, climate) and to develop rapid adaptive responses to environmental cues by producing the best adapted phenotypes.</s><s>Finally, the universality of foraging as a molecular modulator of behavior seems to be strengthened.</s></p></div><figure
