<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Long-distance movement is one of the primary reasons for the evolutionary success of insects throughout the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In some instances, insect species migrate long distances utilizing favorable upper winds, and occasionally even fly over the ocean into another continent, i.e. the painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui (Linnaeus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Long-distance migration is problematic especially when some viruliferous insect pests that damage agricultural crops in one area can migrate into new unaffected areas and transmit pathogenic viruses to crops, causing serious damage.</s><s>Such examples include some aphid species <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Other insect pests migrate regularly only in certain regions and seasons.</s><s>Therefore, it is important to understand the factors controlling the timing and migration routes of migrant insect pests.</s><s>To understand mechanisms of migration, various methods such as behavior observation, gene analysis, meteorological analysis and radar observation have been employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>For example, extensive investigations on the migration in East Asia of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) and the whitebacked planthopper, Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), major insect pests of rice, have revealed their migration source, migration routes, take-off behaviors and other important aspects of their life histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) is another important economic insect pest of rice in East Asia.</s><s>This insect transmits Rice stripe virus and Rice black-streaked dwarf virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>The two viruses have recently re-emerged in East Asia, including eastern China and central Japan, since 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Most notably, an outbreak of L. striatellus occurred in Jiangsu Province in China, and viruliferous, first generation progeny of overwintering L. striatellus occasionally migrated overseas to western Japan and Korea in late May to early June <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>This short period corresponds to the wheat-harvesting season in the province, when a large number of newly emerged insects of the first generation emigrate from harvesting wheat fields to find new hosts, rice plants, producing mass emigrations that occur only once a year during this season <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>An outbreak of rice stripe disease, for example, occurred in 2008 along the Japanese western coastal regions after the first generation of an overwintering L. striatellus population immigrated from overseas into western Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In Nagasaki prefecture, one of the most western prefectures, the occurrence of L. striatellus in that year sharply increased by 126% from the previous year <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Prediction of such overseas migrations of L. striatellus in East Asia provides basic information on the insects' arrival times and areas to local plant protection stations and farmers, and is one of the most important methods for monitoring possible migrations in advance and for efficiently controlling immigrants and their vector-borne diseases subsequent to mass immigrations.</s><s>Forecasted arrival timing is used to predict the emigrants' growth stage or the preferable timing for chemical control.</s><s>Predicted arrival areas are also used to identify possible areas for investigating the occurrence of the pest and for control.</s><s>To forecast long-distance migrations of L. striatellus as accurately as possible, a prediction method has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The method consists of two steps: prediction of the period for insect emigration in eastern China based on the effective accumulated temperature and prediction of insect movement with a migration simulation model during a forecast emigration period <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The simulation model needs the initial time of taking off to initiate a calculation.</s><s>Take-off at dusk and dawn were tentatively used in accordance with the observed behavior of N. lugens and S. furcifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> since observations of L. striatellus take-off are limited.</s></p><p><s>Previously, monitoring of L. striatellus immigrants into rice paddy fields in Japan was conducted at one-or two-hour intervals in June with yellow water-pan traps placed in the paddy fields.</s><s>Using this method, catch peaks occurred around 0500-1100 h and 1500-1800 h Japanese Standard Time (JST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, this method monitored the insect's immigration activity into the paddy fields, not its emigration activity, although the catches should be, to some extent, related to the take-off time from wheat and barley fields.</s><s>In another study, hourly monitoring of L. striatellus with a light trap was conducted during the wheat harvest season in eastern China and peaks of emigrants were trapped at 2000-2100 h Chinese Standard Time (CST) and small catches were trapped at 0500 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>However, the take-off activity in the daytime and early evening was not investigated by these studies since light traps work only during the night.</s><s>Furthermore, confirmation was required that L. striatellus flies at high altitudes in a manner similar to N. lugens, which ascends to make use of winds at high altitudes for its migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Insects show various patterns of flight periodicity based on data from about half a million species collected in suction traps on the ground in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Using entomological radar, the number of targets at altitudes in summer typically peaks at dusk and dawn and a daytime highvalue period, as well as a nighttime layer on some occasions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Practically, the take-off time directly affects the predicted arrival time and area in a migration simulation, since the winds that carry insects change continuously.</s><s>For this reason, it is crucial to know when L. striatellus begins its emigration in order to improve the prediction quality.</s></p><p><s>This study, therefore, monitored the take-off time of emigration of L. striatellus in late May to early June in both China and Japan.</s><s>The monitoring employed several trapping methods at different monitoring heights such as a canopy trap, a suction trap, a pole-mounted net trap, and a balloon-supported or helicopter-towed net trap.</s></p></div>
