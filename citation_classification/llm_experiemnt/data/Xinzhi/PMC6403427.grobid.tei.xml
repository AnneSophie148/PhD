<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Chitin is an essential component of the exoskeletons of insects and plays key roles during growth and development.</s><s>Chitin synthase is the core gene in the chitin synthesis pathway.</s><s>Only one CHS gene was found to be present in aphids, which was named CHS1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>As a vital gene in the regulation of chitin synthesis in the aphids A. glycines <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> , A. citricidus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and Sitobion avenae <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> , study of the function of this gene is helpful not only for understanding aphid development, but also for evaluating it as an RNAi target for potential use in pest control.</s><s>However, in A. pisum, a model organism aphid, little study of CHS has been performed.</s><s>Therefore, here, we first investigated the spatiotemporal expression of ApisCHS in pea aphids.</s><s>In terms of temporal expression, ApisCHS was analysed in different developmental stages.</s><s>Higher expression of ApisCHS was identified in mid-first-and mid-second-instar nymphs, and in mid-fourth-instar nymphs.</s><s>We believe that chitin synthesis is required in these stages for the growth and moulting of aphids.</s><s>Generally, epidermis was the main tissue where the expression of CHS1 could be detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> ; however, in recent research, the expression of CHS1 was also detected in the eggs and ovaries of insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> .</s><s>In the spatial analysis of expression, we confirmed that ApisCHS was expressed in epidermis and embryo.</s><s>We thus hypothesised that ApisCHS may be involved in not only aphid development but also embryonic development.</s><s>Therefore, we investigated the role of ApisCHS by RNAi via dsRNA delivery through injection as well as ingestion.</s><s>In the delivery of dsRNA by injection, 46.3% silencing efficiency was detected in fourth-instar nymphs when a dose of dsRNA of 300 ng was delivered.</s><s>For adults, the relative expression level of CHS was reduced by 51.3% when 600 ng of dsRNA was delivered.</s><s>In addition, no downregulation of CHS was observed at the mRNA level in the fourth-instar nymph and adult stages when lower dsRNA doses (60 and 120 ng) were applied.</s><s>These findings imply that a lower dsRNA dose could be the reason why no RNAi silencing was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> .</s><s>However, we encountered the problem that the microinjection was also harmful to fourth-instar nymphs and induced nonspecific mortality in pea aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> .</s><s>Compared with injection, ingestion is not only a more natural method to deliver dsRNA, but could also mimic transgenic plants for expressing dsApisCHS, which enhanced the further step of applying RNAi as sucking-pest control <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</s><s>The successful silencing of the target gene by administering dsRNA via ingestion was reported in pea aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> .</s><s>In the current study, we used V. faba seedlings as a vector to deliver dsRNA.</s><s>Exogenous dsRNA was transported via the stem and leaves, and then ingested by aphids.</s><s>The significant reduction of ApisCHS was detected when the dsRNA concentration reached 1,200 ng•μL -1 ; however, no gene silencing effect was detected when the dsRNA concentration reached 800 ng•μL -1 .</s><s>Although it is very difficult to accurately evaluate the amount of dsRNA ingested by aphids, it could be speculated that certain factors influence the efficiency of RNAi in considering the dsRNA delivery by plants.</s><s>For instance, dsRNA in V. faba seedlings could be processed into siRNAs by plant RNAi machinery, which limited the efficacy of RNAi <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> ; meanwhile, dsRNA could also be degraded by saliva of aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Generally, for homometabolous and hemimetabolous insects, the reduction of CHS1 disrupts the growth of larvae or nymphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>This result was also demonstrated by the phenotype associated with injection-based RNAi in the present study.</s><s>ApisCHS was reduced at the fourth-instar nymph stage, leading to increased mortality and decreased moulting success.</s><s>In contrast, such phenotypes were not observed in RNAi-based ApisCHS silencing in adults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>One possible explanation for this is that CHS plays a more critical role in the growth of nymphs than in adults, since adults are fully mature.</s><s>However, another intriguing phenotype was identified: Some newborn nymphs born to the surviving fourth-instar nymphs that reached adulthood were deformed, although the deformity rate was very low.</s><s>A similar phenotype was also observed by ingestion-based dsRNA delivery.</s><s>A deformity rate in newborn nymphs of 44.2% was detected in aphids that ingested dsApisCHS, together with reductions of the reproduction rate and the size of embryos as well as newborn nymphs.</s><s>These results confirm that the development of embryos was blocked by dsApisCHS.</s><s>CHS is one of the most important factors required for embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> .</s><s>The disrupted synthesis of chitin by CHS through RNAi can disrupt embryonic development, leading to nymph malformation.</s><s>Compared with the control dsGFP treated aphids, the ingestion of the dsRNA in targeting ApisCHS significantly delayed the overall development duration of the aphids.</s><s>As we know, ApisCHS is highly expressed in the epidermis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) and it is one of the most key genes to control the development of aphids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>By deleption of the expression of ApisCHS via ingestion of specific-dsRNA targeting ApisCHS from 1 st instar aphids until the adults, would inhibit the synthesis of chitin constantly and resulted in a cumulative effect in the overall development of the aphids, specially 3 rd instar to 4 th instar, and 4 th instar to adult (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>However, although extension of the developmental period of nymphs occurred, no mortality occurred from the stage of newborn nymphs to adults upon the ingestion of dsApisCHS.</s><s>A possible explanation for this is that the gene silencing efficiency of dsRNA-feeding-based RNAi is lower than for injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which was insufficient to induce severe phenotypes such as mortality.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in this study we investigated the involvement of ApisCHS in aphids and embryonic development through injection-or ingestion-based RNAi.</s><s>We confirmed that ApisCHS plays a key role during the growth and embryonic development of pea aphids and silencing of this gene could lead to the inhibition of both aphid growth and embryonic development.</s><s>In addition, although injection-based RNAi presented higher gene silencing efficiency than ingestion-based RNAi in our experimental set-up, injection is limited to only the study of gene function in the lab, while plant-mediated RNAi is not only a more natural method to deliver dsRNA, but could also be applied as a mimic of transgenic plants expressing dsApisCHS, which would enhance the further step of applying RNAi as sucking-pest control.</s><s>However, biosafety evaluation is indeed another important issue here.</s><s>To further analyze this, the similarity of these targeted fragments in three aphid species, including A. piusm, Myzus persicae, and Aphis glycines, were checked by using DNAMAN (Lynnon Biosoft, CA, USA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>These fragments showed an average of 95.70% similarity with each other.</s><s>However, only ~68.17% similarities were obtained in comparison with beneficial insects, such as Copidosoma floridanum and Apis mellifera.</s><s>The similarities among the aphids themselves and other beneficial insects showed a significant gap, which could be helpful to design an RNAi-based pesticide to target on various aphids while could be still safe to beneficial insects, but without strict biosafety evaluation procedure, it is still difficult to make such a conclusion in this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .</s><s>To date, plant-mediated RNAi has been applied in several aphid species, including M. persicae <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> , S. avenae <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> and A. citricidus <ref

reduced reproduction.</s><s>These results are consistent with our study and also provide the potential method to use plant-mediated RNAi to manage aphid pest.</s></p><p><s>Here, successful plant-mediated RNAi for pea aphids demonstrated the potential of using RNAi for aphid control.</s><s>Based on our research, further study should be performed to test the pest control capacity of
