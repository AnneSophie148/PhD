the fungal propagules.</s><s>The insect cuticle is typically hydrophobic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, and the adhesion of the fungal propagule, i.e., conidia or blastospore, is determined primarily by hydrophobic interactions on the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Both BotaniGard and Met52 contain aerial conidia that are hydrophobic <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, and PFR-97 contains blastospores that are hydrophilic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The hydrophobic conidia initially have greater non-specific binding to the hydrophobic cuticle than the hydrophilic blastospores <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>However, due to the hydrophobic properties of B. bassiana and M. brunneum conidia compared to the hydrophilic properties of the I. fumosorosea blastospores on the beetle surface, it is possible that after washing the spores off of the beetle surface using the surfactant Triton X-100 (0.01% v/v) that this procedure may not have removed all the blastospores adhering to the beetle cuticle, which may account for variations in the number of spores recovered for PFR-97 treatments compared to BotaniGard and Met52 from some of the beetle species.</s><s>This hypothesis still warrants more research, especially with reference to the effect of hydrophilic properties and the adherence of I. fumosorosea blastospores to the insect cuticle when using this washing technique for removing blastospores from the insect cuticle.</s></p><p><s>For the control, distilled water was used only, which is a realistic control to assess the efficacy of PFR-97 (I.</s><s>fumosorosea), which is a dry desiccation-tolerant blastospore-formulated powder with no surfactants or emulsifiers added to the formulation.</s><s>When PFR-97 is mixed in water, the spores will suspend immediately in the supernatant; however, this is not the case for BotaniGard ES (B.</s><s>bassiana) or Met52 EC (M.</s><s>brunneum).</s><s>Both of these conidial formulated fungal products contain a proprietary mixture of surfactants and emulsifiers suspended in oil that allows the spores to suspend when mixed in water.</s><s>Therefore, in future bioassays, water only and the resultant supernatant minus the spores would be a more appropriate control when assessing the efficacy of these commercially-formulated fungal products.</s></p><p><s>Adult beetles in our study using the paper disk bioassay technique were exposed to the formulated fungal products in two ways, either indirectly by residual contact or directly by per os inoculation, i.e., ingesting or acquiring the spores while chewing the inoculated disk.</s><s>All of the adult beetles chewed on the paper disk in the bioassay chamber and had the opportunity to obtain spores per os, as well as acquire spores on their body parts as they roamed on the inoculated disk.</s><s>Fernandez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> observed that the second instar of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), acquired a high density of B. bassiana conidia on the legs, mouthparts and ventral surface areas when roaming on sprayed potato foliage.</s><s>Although the Colorado potato beetle larva was contaminated, they suggested that mortality probably occurred because of infection through the cuticle of the beetle and not by ingesting B. bassiana conidia while feeding on the leaf surface.</s><s>Therefore, in our study, the adherence of propagules obtained from the spore residue on the paper disk may have played a significant role in mortality and its efficacy may be directly related to the formulation specifics of each of the fungal products.</s><s>Although speculative, this hypothesis warrants further research to elucidate the role that each inoculation process may play in the overall mortality of the different adult ambrosia beetle species.</s></p><p><s>In our study, the mean survival of the different ambrosia beetle species per formulation varied similarly to that of their spore acquisition.</s><s>Beetles exposed to the disks inoculated with B. bassiana and M. brunneum died significantly faster than those with I. fumosorosea.</s><s>As stated above, BotaniGard and Met52 are both oil/emulsifier-formulated, and PFR-97 is a blastospore powder-type product.</s><s>The B. bassiana and M. brunneum treatments, when applied in oil-in-water emulsion, will have conidia generally surrounded by oil droplets, which may enhance their adherence to the insect cuticle.</s><s>Prior et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> demonstrated that B. bassiana conidia in an oil-based formulation adhered significantly better to the cuticle of the cocoa weevil, Pantorhytes plutus (Oberthür), and enhanced higher mortality with a lower lethal time value compared to the water formulation.</s><s>Under laboratory and field conditions, Batta <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> demonstrated a significantly higher level of efficacy with formulated B. bassiana conidia in an emulsion compared to no emulsion against the almond bark beetle, Scolytus amygdali Guérin-Méneville.</s><s>In another study, Carrillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, using the same paper disk bioassay technique described above at the same suspension concentration per fungal product, found that the oil/emulsifier-formulated BotaniGard and Met52 had a higher mortality compared to the I. fumosorosea blastospore-powder formulated PFR-97 product and water only.</s><s>Overall, oil-based formulations of fungal conidial biopesticides have been reported to increase the adherence of propagules to the insect integument by: (1) enhancing the spread of the inoculum and subsequent penetration of the insect cuticle, (2) protecting propagules from ultraviolet light radiation and (3) enhancing infection under low humidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Factors that may inhibit or enhance germination and penetration include cuticle density or compounds on the insect integument <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the lack of nutrients on sclerotized beetle cuticle is a limiting factor in fungal growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Other physical or chemical aspects defining the interactions at the cuticle barrier between the entomopathogenic fungus and insect that ultimately can lead to either successful mycosis by the entomopathogen or successful defense by the host have been extensively reviewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Our data suggest that the formulation of each EPF can affect the adherence of spores to beetles, which could have a subsequent positive effect on reducing the spread of R. lauricola.</s><s>Considering that these bioassays were conducted under optimum laboratory conditions, the apparent positive effect of the conidial oil-based formulations remains to be confirmed under field conditions.</s></p><p><s>The ambrosia beetle species that are vectors of R. lauricola are morphologically different, but their reproductive behavior should be similar to that of X. glabratus.</s><s>Ideally, EPF treatments could prevent ambrosia beetles from boring into the trees, thereby potentially eliminating the risk of R. lauricola transmission.</s><s>However, Carrillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> found that that X. glabratus females were able to bore into avocado log bolts and construct galleries regardless of the fungal treatment.</s><s>Carrillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> also observed that even if the EPF-infected beetle bores into the tree, the mycosed insect inside the tree will kill the next-generation brood.</s><s>Brar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> observed that X. glabratus females excavate a primary gallery that can branch into secondary and tertiary galleries where eggs are laid, ~7 days after gallery initiation.</s><s>The median and mean survival times of X. glabratus and the other ambrosia beetle females in our study exposed to EPF ranged from 3-5 days based on a dose of 2.4 × 10 6 spores/mL.</s><s>This spore concentration tested under laboratory conditions is much lower compared to a typical rate applied in the field (e.g., 8.8 × 10 7 spores/mL for BotaniGard ES), yet it provided efficacious mortality.</s><s>Although all tested fungal formulated products can prevent beetle reproduction, the most effective fungal product will be the one causing the highest beetle mortality regardless of their survivorship times.</s><s>In addition, the entomopathogenic fungal infection of adult ambrosia beetle females could potentially suppress the growth or establishment of their fungal symbionts in the galleries that become contaminated with entomopathogenic and saprophytic organisms associated with the beetle cadavers.</s><s>Results from laboratory competition in vitro studies indicate that the biofungicide product RootShield ® Plus + WP, containing Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and T. virens (J.H. Mill., Giddens &amp; A.A. Foster), can inhibit the radial hyphal growth of R. lauricola (P.</s><s>Avery, unpublished data).</s><s>Perhaps, this biofungicidal product could be applied on the trunk of the avocado trees along with the EPF and potentially reduce the spread of R. lauricola in the groves.</s><s>This promising strategy warrants much more research for determining the most efficacious application of the selected biopesticides under laboratory and then field conditions.</s></p><p><s>In our experiments, beetles were offered the inoculated paper disk in a no-choice condition and exposed to EPF over time.</s><s>This same paper disk bioassay technique was used by Carrillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> for testing the same EPF against X. glabratus which resulted in similar findings to our study.</s><s>Although our findings using this technique showed significant differences among treatments and the control, the short mean longevity of beetles in the controls (~7-8 days) and relatedness to the natural conditions in the field were a concern when assessing the efficacy of these fungal products.</s><s>The poor survival of X. volvulus and X. bispinatus beetles could be attributed to the fact that the inoculated paper disk in each vial did not remain as moist throughout the day as those with the X. crassiusculus beetles.</s><s>During the bioassay trials with X. crassiusculus beetles, the inoculated disks were watered twice a day, whereas the disks that the X. volvulus and X. bispinatus beetles were exposed to were watered once due to the lack of labor availability.</s><s>Therefore, due to the concern noted above, an improved avocado bark plug bioassay is being designed for exposing the beetles to each fungal product under semi-natural field conditions (P.</s><s>Avery, personal communication).</s></p><p><s>Due to the similarity of the life histories and behavior of X. crassiusculus, X. volvulus and X. bispinatus to X. glabratus, we will use X. glabratus as a model system because it has been studied extensively compared to the other beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The model system will be used to visually describe a possible scenario where using EPF as a pest management strategy can be more efficacious than just applying conventional insecticides.</s><s>According to observations by Brar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, these ambrosia beetles have a unimodal dispersal peak, engaging in host-seeking flight during the late afternoon, which is directed by plant host-based volatiles, primarily sesquiterpenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Upon finding a host tree, the beetles roam on the bark of the tree trunk for relatively long periods of time (~1 h, D. Carrillo, personal observation) before boring into the trunk.</s><s>During the roaming time, the beetles might be exposed to fungal spores by landing on an EPF-contaminated bait station or bark surface of a host tree prior to engaging in another host-seeking flight.</s><s>Carrillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> found high infection rates in beetles interacting with wood treated with the different fungi and suggested that trunk sprays or bait stations where the beetles land and interact with a fungus-treated surface could act as delivery and auto-dissemination systems.</s><s>Improving the delivery system of fungal strains could result in increased mortality rates of ambrosia beetle females.</s></p><p><s>Xyleborus volvulus and X. bispinatus are confirmed vectors of R. lauricola that can kill an avocado tree by the inoculation of a few spores.</s><s>This transmission of the pathogen definitely increases the challenge of achieving an integrated pest management approach and thereby the probability that conventional insecticides will need to be applied often by avocado growers.</s><s>The current pest management strategy is based on early detection and removal of diseased trees to eliminate beetle breeding sites and fungal inoculum sources.</s><s>The diseased trees are uprooted, stump and roots burned, the trunk and limbs chipped and the chips and adjacent trees sprayed with synthetic insecticides.</s><s>Our results suggest that applications of EPF, in combination with other management tactics, including the use of compatible conventional pesticides, might suppress beetle populations that vector R. lauricola to avocados and mitigate the adverse effects of this beetle-disease complex.</s><s>In another study, work is ongoing to determine the conventional agrochemicals commonly used by growers that are compatible with the commercially-available fungal biopesticides containing EPF, which can be applied together for management of the ambrosia beetles vectoring R. lauricola to avocado trees.</s></p></div>
