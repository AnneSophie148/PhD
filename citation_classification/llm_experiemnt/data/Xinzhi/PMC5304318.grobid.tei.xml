host adaptation of insect pests to their host plant.</s></p><p><s>Variations in host plant suitability can affect life table parameters of herbivorous insects.</s><s>Use of the age-stage, two-sex life table method in this study graphically demonstrated the adaptation of the SBPH to the four different rice cultivars, SD13, SD14, SD15, and ZXN, which are the primary Japonica rice cultivars grown in Shandong Province.</s></p><p><s>The intrinsic rate of increase (r) is a key parameter in measuring a plant's resistance to insects because it reflects the physiological qualities of an animal in relation to its capacity to increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>It is, therefore, one of the most appropriate indices for evaluating the performance of an insect on host plants as well as the host plant's suitability to herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Comparisons of the r or R 0 values between different

survival rate was low.</s><s>The low preadult survival rate of SD 15 was mainly due to the low egg hatch rate.</s><s>Population projections based on an age-stage, two-sex life table can predict changes of stage structure during population growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Our projections demonstrated that the growth of the SBPH population would be the fastest  on cultivar SD15 and the slowest on SD13 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>Projections are also useful in providing valuable information on the trends and emergence timing of not only the preadult stages, but the female and male adult emergences as well.</s><s>This information is also relevant for implementing pest control schedules using more conventional means of control including pesticides or physical control (e.g., light traps).</s><s>The different fitness levels of the SBPH on new and existing rice cultivars can be used as indicators in screening resistance genes in rice breeding programs.</s></p><p><s>In previous studies, fecundity was determined by daily observations on the deposited eggs until the female adults died

production where the eggs laid by females were counted every five days instead of daily.</s><s>Our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> indicated that no significant differences occurred in the population parameters (intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R 0 ), mean generation time (T), preadult duration, fecundity, female longevity and male longevity) obtained through daily sampling versus the interval-grouped data, except in the adult preoviposition period (APOP) and oviposition days.</s><s>In this study, "five days" was considered to be an appropriate sampling interval because the eggs generally begin to hatch on the sixth day when kept at a suitable temperature e.g., 28 °C25 .</s></p><p><s>Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> pointed out that the number of eggs laid by the planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), on the rice cultivar "Taichung Native 1" (O.</s><s>sativa indica TN1) decreased significantly compared to the number found by Kisimoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>The difference may be due to the daily replacement of rice plants disturbing the feeding and oviposition behavior of the female planthoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>The simplified recording method used in this study, will not only save considerable time and labor, but would also significantly reduce the amount of disruption to the insect's behavior caused by the replacement of host plants.</s><s>If the procedure becomes more widely adopted in life table studies, it may help to promote further applications of the life table method and thereby benefit future ecological research.</s><s>This study is the first to apply a simplified
