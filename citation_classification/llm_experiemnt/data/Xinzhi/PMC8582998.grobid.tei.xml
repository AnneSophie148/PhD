<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>RNAi can be driven by endogenous or exogenous RNA molecules that are processed in eukaryotic cells by RNase-III-type enzymes

RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which serves as a guide for searching RNA targets based on base complementary.</s><s>Target RNAs can be processed in various ways, but the whole mechanism typically results in reduced gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Due to its mechanistic simplicity, RNAi has become a powerful tool for basic research and biotechnological applications.</s><s>While transgenic technologies may be ideal for inducing RNAi, stringent legislation regarding genetically modified organisms makes it necessary to consider exogenously supplied RNA molecules in many instances.</s><s>However, possibly due to its intrinsically low halflife, there is no easy way to produce the large amounts of recombinant RNAs that are required for many practical

survive and replicate in the hostile environment of the host cell.</s><s>The circular, highly base-paired viroid structure -likely bound to the co-expressed tRNA ligase -provides the recombinant RNA with high stability and exonuclease resistance, contributing to the vast accumulation (tens of milligrams per litre of E. coli culture in laboratory conditions) of the RNA of interest in this system.</s><s>However, this system proved to be inefficient for producing the long dsRNAs that are preferred for inducing RNAi in many applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we aimed to adapt the viroid-based system for producing recombinant RNA in E. coli to generate the dsRNAs that are used for RNAi-based pest control.</s><s>As a target, we chose D. virgifera, a relevant corn pest for which RNAi-based control has been recently demonstrated by targeting the DvSSJ1 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>To express a dsRNA homologous to a fragment of the DvSSJ1 gene in the viroid-based

corresponding to a self-splicing group-I intron from T. thermophila.</s><s>Group I introns are found in genes encoding proteins, rRNA, and tRNA in algae, fungi, lichens, some lower eukaryotes, and especially in bacteria.</s><s>These introns are ribozymes, capable of catalysing their own splicing from primary transcripts without the involvement of any protein or additional factor, other than Mg 2+ and guanosine <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the full-length cDNA of the T. thermophila 26S rRNA intron (433 nt), we added each 10-nt flanking exon to ensure optimal recognition of intronexon boundaries.</s><s>As expected, the separation of the inverted repeats with the intron plus flanking exons was key to achieving plasmid stability in E. coli (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>The expression of the corresponding precursor transcript in an E. coli RNase III-deficient strain, along with that of the eggplant tRNA ligase, led to the efficient accumulation of chimeric molecules of circular RNA consisting of the ELVd scaffold containing the 83-nt DvSSJ1 hairpin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the 433-nt processed intron also accumulated in E. coli, while unprocessed intermediates were not detected, indicating very efficient T. thermophila group-I intron self-cleavage in bacteria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>The amount of the chimeric RNA containing the dsRNA of interest increased with time up to 24 h in the E. coli culture, in contrast to the usual 12-h accumulation peak of single-stranded RNA aptamers, as in Spinach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The amount decreased after that point, with the band of circular RNA at 40 h being almost negligible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the 50-fold upscaling of production (maintaining the expression conditions) does not seem to affect the large-scale accumulation of the dsRNA of interest.</s><s>Thus, we suggest that this approach is an efficient way to produce large amounts of recombinant dsRNAs, due to the fact that both the scaffolding and the hairpin loop are constructed to avoid degradation by the bacterial RNases.</s></p><p><s>The produced dsRNA maintains a potent anti-WCR activity, as we observed in the WCR larvae feeding bioassay (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>As previously shown, the inserted RNA is fully functional, probably due to the position in which the recombinant RNA is inserted -at the end of the right upper arm, thus allowing both scaffold and recombinant RNA to form two independent domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it should be noted that the silencing obtained with the ELVd-dsRNA chimera is slightly better than that obtained using the same dsRNA molecules produced by in vitro transcription (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We speculate that the presence of the protective scaffold may help increase the half-life of dsRNA during its production and application, both in the field and in the intestines and cells of insects, thereby making it available for processing by the RNAi machinery in greater quantities than the same dsRNA produced in vitro.</s></p><p><s>Various releasing methods have been described to remove the protective scaffold after expression of recombinant RNA.</s><s>In vitro strategies such as the use of RNases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> or sequencespecific DNAzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, although they remove single-stranded RNA, would add an additional layer to the production system.</s><s>Furthermore, the resulting RNA would not be circular.</s><s>Another feasible approach is to flank the recombinant RNA ends with hammerhead ribozymes, which leads to in vivo efficient cleavage of the RNA of interest and its release as a linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> or even a circular molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>In this work, we explore the use of an additional copy of the same group-I autocatalytic intron, although in a permuted fashion in which the 3ʹ half of the intron is placed upstream of the 5ʹ half (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>As reported, both intron halves undergo the two transesterification reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, even inserting between both halves very long sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> such as, in this case, the long inverted repeats plus the fulllength separating intron.</s><s>The resulting product is a circular molecule composed of the dsRNA locked at both sides by loops derived from the exon fragments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This strategy allows us to remove the viroid scaffolding without losing, in the final molecule, two key characteristics in recombinant RNA accumulation -circularity and compaction -that make the molecules highly resistant to degradation, as seen from the fact that they accumulate in large quantities in the bacteria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, although there are two complete intron sequences, they are both removed correctly without mutual interference.</s><s>Due to the efficient self-splicing of both introns, the circular dsRNA can be efficiently obtained in E. coli, even if neither the eggplant tRNA ligase nor the viroid scaffold are present (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Note that we did not assay the insecticidal activity of the released circular dsRNA, although taking into consideration that the chimeric ELVd-DvSSJ1 and the empty ELVd scaffold displayed, respectively, strong and negligible anti-WCR activities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), the free circular DvSSJ1 dsRNA is likely to also possess insecticidal activity.</s></p><p><s>Purified dsRNA or even inactivated complete bacterial extracts have been used to induce RNAi effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>For many applications, it is preferable, however, to completely isolate the dsRNA from other bacterial RNAs.</s><s>Thus, both recombinant dsRNAs produced here could be purified by affinity chromatography, using recombinant-specific dsRNAbinding proteins or antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>The circularity of the produced molecules and the absence of such structures in E. coli may also be exploited, as the circular molecules can be purified to homogeneity by 2D-PAGE, both under denaturing conditions (with reduction of the ionic strength in the second separation) and subsequent elution from the gel.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have developed a strategy to adapt our viroid-based expression system to overproduce in E. coli RNA hairpins with extended double-stranded regions able to induce RNAi in insects, as we demonstrate in the case of WCR.</s><s>Further, we used a second self-splicing group-I intron (permuted) to produce very compact circular dsRNAs in which the viroid scaffold is completely removed in vivo.</s><s>Both strategies are based on the activity of autocatalytic introns.</s><s>We assert that they are fast, high-output, cost-effective, and scalable alternatives for industrially producing the large amounts of large dsRNAs that are required in pest control approaches.</s><s>Because of their robustness and flexibility,
