<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Phytoplasmas are prokaryotes belonging to the class Mollicutes, a group of wall-less microorganisms phylogenetically related to low G + C content, Gram-positive bacteria, that are associated worldwide to diseases of important crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasmas are mainly transmitted by phloem feeding leafhoppers, planthoppers and psyllids within the Hemiptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasma transmission is persistent and propagative, involving a latent period in the vector during which ingested phytoplasmas actively multiply and pass from the alimentary canal through the midgut into the haemocoel, finally colonizing salivary gland cells before being transmitted to a new host plant.</s><s>Vectors remain infective for their whole life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Transmission of plant pathogens by insect vectors is a complex biological process involving interactions between plant, insect, and pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and insect vector specificity plays a key role in the epidemiology of several vector-pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>For phytoplasmas, behavioral, environmental and geographical factors are involved in determining vector specificity (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), but also molecular interactions between membrane proteins of phytoplasma and vector may be implicated.</s><s>Indeed, such interactions have been evoked in other plant pathogenvector combinations.</s><s>For example, spiroplasma spiralin protein binds to insect glycoproteins and plays a key role in the transmission of Spiroplasma citri by mediating its adherence to epithelial cells of insect vector gut or salivary gland <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The specific binding of spiroplasma phosphoglycerate kinase to vector actin is crucial for internalization of the bacteria in the insect cells, with a direct effect on spiroplasma transmission in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, cell surface haemagglutinin-like proteins of Xylella fastidiosa bind to different glycoproteins during initial adhesion steps in the colonization of its xylem feeder vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The transmission of vector borne bacteria is a complex biological process, probably due to the elaborate composition of the bacterial membrane proteome, as shown by masking different X. fastidiosa epitopes with antibodies raised against whole bacterial cells, gum and afimbrial adhesins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasmas lack a cell wall, therefore their plasma membrane is in direct contact with the host cytoplasm.</s><s>Membrane proteins with hydrophilic domains exposed on the outer part of the cell are good candidate partners for molecular interactions between the mollicute and the insect vector.</s><s>Three types of non-homologous but highly abundant and immunodominant membrane proteins (IDP) have been identified in phytoplasmas: Amp, IdpA, and Imp <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>These proteins are highly variable even among closely related strains of different ribosomal groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and this variability is higher than that of other adjacent metabolic genes or non-coding sequences.</s><s>Indeed, evolution under strong positive selection has been demonstrated for Amp and Imp <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Putative transmembrane proteins are also encoded by phytoplasma plasmid genes which might have a role in interaction with the insect host <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>One such transmembrane protein of 'Ca.</s><s>P. asteris' onion yellows strain (OYP) is preferentially expressed in the infected vector, and its absence in a noninsect-transmissible mutant isolate has been linked to the loss of transmissibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, a mollicute adhesin motif, present on a putative transmembrane protein of OYP, was shown to be required for interaction with plant and vector proteins in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In vitro studies have demonstrated that phytoplasma IDPs may interact with both insect and plant host proteins.</s><s>In the case of OYP, the formation of a complex between Amp and insect actin microfilaments has been correlated with the phytoplasma transmission capability of leafhoppers, suggesting that the interaction between Amp and insect microfilaments plays a role in phytoplasma transmissibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Much evidence has also indicated a specific in vitro interaction between 'Ca.</s><s>P. asteris' chrysanthemum yellows strain (CYP) Amp and several vector proteins, among which myosin, actin and ATP synthase <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The latter protein was shown to be present on the microvillar external surface of the gut epithelial cells as well as on the plasma membrane of the salivary gland cells, two crucial organs for the infection process.</s><s>Moreover, phytoplasma IDPs interact with plant proteins, such as the case of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' Imp interacting with plant actin .</s><s>The role of the potential interaction between phytoplasma IDPs and vector proteins in the transmission process has not been addressed so far, probably due to the recalcitrant nature of these plant pathogens for which a recent claim of cultivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> has not been further supported.</s></p><p><s>The aims of this work were to provide the first experimental evidence that in vivo interaction between phytoplasma membrane protein and vector proteins has a role in the transmission process and to identify the topology of the interaction at the gut epithelium and/or salivary glands, the two barriers encountered by the phytoplasma during its colonization of the vector.</s><s>Experiments were performed on the phytoplasma CYP, which is associated with a disease of ornamental plants in north-western Italy, and the two leafhoppers Macrosteles quadripunctulatus Kirschbaum and Euscelidius variegatus Kirschbaum, the most important and efficient vectors of this pathogen.</s><s>Protocols for separately addressing the two barriers (gut epithelium and salivary glands) were developed, and the in vivo interactions between CYP membrane protein Amp and vector proteins were studied by evaluating their effects on phytoplasma acquisition and inoculation by the two insect vectors.</s></p></div>
