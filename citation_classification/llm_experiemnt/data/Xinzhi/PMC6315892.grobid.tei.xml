plastic tray that was placed below the branch.</s></p><p><s>Insects 2018, 9, 175 5 of 18</s></p><p><s>Immediately after, spittlebugs were collected with an aspirator.</s><s>The method was applied to 30 trees (randomly distributed), one branch per tree, over a 1 ha area per each sampling date.</s><s>This method was not used during the rest of the sampling season because spittlebugs often jumped off the tray before collection.</s><s>Instead, the branch shaking methodology consisted of placing a large plastic bag (60 × 60 cm) over each olive branch, which was shaken six consecutive times.</s><s>Then, the bag was gently removed from the branch and closed.</s><s>We used one bag per two branches, one branch per tree, collecting a total of 15 samples per sampling site, which corresponded to 30 randomly distributed trees.</s><s>Regarding the yellow-sticky traps, we placed two yellow sticky traps (25 × 20 cm) per tree on three olive trees over a 1 ha area, replacing the traps every two weeks.</s><s>The two sticky traps were placed on a branch 1 m and 1.8 m above ground level.</s><s>Furthermore, aerial sweep net canopy sampling was carried out in two locations (Constantina and Osuna, Sevilla, Spain) from March to June 2016.</s><s>The olive tree canopy was sampled by selecting six trees in each sampling point and sweeping each tree twice with the help of an entomological sweep net.</s><s>This procedure was repeated once every two weeks in five sites within a radius of 100 m transect per grove.</s><s>A total of 30 trees (5 samples × 6 trees/sample) were sampled per sampling site and date.</s><s>Finally, from July to September 2016 we tested the sticky-shoot method in Morata de Tajuña, Madrid.</s><s>Souverode Aerosol glue (Plantin SARL, Courthézon, France) was sprayed on a single branch of five olive trees, within a radius of 100 m per field.</s><s>Branches were removed every two weeks and examined in the laboratory for spittlebug identification.</s></p><p><s>The sampling protocol was modified in 2017 based on the results obtained in 2016 and the most efficient sampling methods were selected.</s><s>Thus, in 2017 the olive tree canopies were sampled by branch shaking and by aerial sweep net, which were the two most promising sampling procedures.</s><s>Moreover, we incorporated an interception-sticky trap (Figure <ref

(2018) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> described a bivoltine cycle for spittlebugs in Greece.</s><s>Likewise, Drosopoulos and Asche (2001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> described the bivoltine life cycle of P. spumarius in Greece.</s><s>Nevertheless, these authors did not report any eggs or any trace of nymphs of a new generation of spittlebugs in the summer, which may indicate migration of adults into long-distance areas instead of a second generation of spittlebugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In the Iberian Peninsula the absence of nymphs (easily visible by the "spittle" that they produce) in late summer or early autumn indicates that spittlebugs have a univoltine life cycle.</s><s>Thus, adults tend to migrate in summer to sheltered areas and come back to the olive groves in autumn after the first rains during the regrowth of the ground cover vegetation.</s></p><p><s>We did not find any Cercopiodea in the Mengibar (Jaén) region nor close to the X. fastidiosa-infected area in Alicante.</s><s>The absence of spittlebugs in the Mengibar region is not surprising because of the large dryland monoculture of olives, where tillage is a common practice and almost no ground vegetation is present.</s><s>Preliminary surveys were made in November 2017 in the Alicante region and subsequent samplings in spring 2018 in an organic almond grove located in el Valle de Guadalest showed that N. campestris and P. spumarius were present in the ground cover as well as in the almond tree canopy (data not shown).</s><s>El Valle de Guadalest is an agricultural system consisting of almond and olive mixed patches surrounded by natural vegetation (mainly pine trees).</s><s>This landscape situation implies a high risk of X. fastidiosa infection of the olive groves.</s><s>Therefore, despite no infected olive trees having yet been detected, the presence of spittlebugs in these olive groves is a threat to growers.</s><s>Variation in vector population structure strongly affects any kind of general assumption on the pattern of disease spread, also impacting the efficacy of vector control strategies.</s><s>This phenomenon urgently calls for studies on factors affecting spittlebug distribution and large-scale modeling in different agroecosystems.</s></p><p><s>Our data obtained from the 2016 and 2017 surveys of the olive groves selected in mainland Spain and northeastern Portugal, regardless of the sampling method used, showed that P. spumarius and N. campestris do not use olive trees as their main host plant.</s><s>Instead, they spend most of their life cycle (spring, beginning of the summer, and fall) on the ground and, in summer, migrate from the olive grove to other sheltered unmanaged habitats and tend to settle on host plants other than olive trees.</s><s>Therefore, olive trees act only as transient hosts for spittlebugs when the ground vegetation dries out and is no longer available.</s><s>Nevertheless, our data suggest that P. spumarius and N. campestris could play a key role in the transmission of X. fastidiosa in olive groves in the Iberian Peninsula.</s><s>Olive trees could be exposed to transmission of the pathogen from the end of the spring throughout the summer or even the beginning of the autumn, at the time when the spittlebugs tend to disperse, searching for oversummering hosts and later returning to the olive grove.</s><s>Transmission of X. fastidiosa is a fast process (less than 1 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and the vectors do not need to establish and colonize the plants to transmit the pathogen.</s><s>Absence of P. spumarius nymphs within several groves does not preclude immigration from surrounding habitats toward the crop.</s><s>Therefore, monitoring and control of vectors should be applied to the widest area possible.</s></p><p><s>Although the population density in the Iberian Peninsula seems relatively low compared to the situation reported for southern Italian olive groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, P. spumarius was the most common vector of X. fastidiosa found on olive canopies in our survey.</s><s>N. campestris was collected from olive canopies just occasionally in two of the surveyed sites.</s><s>However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Purcell (1980)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and a study on the epidemiology of almond leaf scorch (a disease of almond caused by X. fastidiosa), in a low-density plantation and with the bacterium spreading slowly within the host plant, even a very low density of transmitting individuals, hardly detectable with conventional survey techniques, could account for considerable bacterium net incidence over a period of years.</s><s>Furthermore, N. campestris seems to be widespread in Spain and northeastern Portugal, and could possibly be involved in the transmission of X. fastidiosa to hosts other than olive, as well as in the maintenance of inoculum sources in herbaceous hosts.</s></p><p><s>Finally, our work further stresses the general lack of knowledge on variation in spittlebug population structure and how abiotic and biotic factors may modulate their occurrence.</s><s>To set up an effective sampling protocol integrating different methods and model environmental factors and management practices that drive the abundance and population density of spittlebugs are major challenges for the coming years.</s></p></div>
