<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>We report new data related to new epidemiological situations as a result of the particular environmental situations in apple production in NW Spain.</s><s>Our cider-apple orchards are inhabited by an abundant and rich psyllid community, including the two so far known AP-vectors as well as exotic species and others which are not supposed to use apple as host.</s><s>Total captures of C. picta (79) were clearly higher than those of C. melanoneura (27) and, although both detection rates were rather similar (around 10 %), rate of C. picta is more significant because the percentage of positive specimens was more regular among orchards.</s><s>Thus, C. picta is likely the putative vector in our region, although a contribution of C. melanoneura or other species cannot be discarded.</s><s>Anyway, the wide distribution of the disease and the high rate of symptomatic trees in our region contrast with the low density of the known vectors.</s><s>Multiplication of infected plant material and root bridges between nearby trees could be also contributing to spread the phytoplasma among and inside orchards, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ciccotti et al. 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In any case, the discovery of other four psyllid species, apart from the known vectors, carrying the phytoplasma reveals that our knowledge on the potential vectors is quite limited and goes far beyond the typical ones.</s><s>More research is clearly needed to unravel the role of the psyllid fauna inhabiting our orchards in the transmission of the phytoplasma as well as to evaluate the influence of the surrounding landscape.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Map indicating the location of the five orchards where psyllids were sampled.</s><s>(1 Siero, 2 Nava, 3 Colunga, 4 Villa 1, 5 Villa 2)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,62.75,94.96,470.52,301.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>
