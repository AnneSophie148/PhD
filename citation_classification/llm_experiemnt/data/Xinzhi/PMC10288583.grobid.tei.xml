target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>In 2003, Austin Burt proposed the use of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) for control of pest populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The central idea was to adapt an HEG to recognize an essential gene in the species of interest, for example, a gene required for female development.</s><s>Following the introduction of a double-strand break (DSB) by the homing endonuclease, repair through homology-directed repair (HDR) led to copying or "homing" of the HEG into the targeted gene.</s><s>A homing event in the germline would convert a heterozygous allele to homozygous resulting in super-Mendelian inheritance of any given trait or genetic elements.</s><s>HEG (I-SceI)-based homing gene drives have been successfully performed in Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Since it proved difficult in practice to adapt HEGs to target essential genes, the advent of easily programmable "RNA-guided endonucleases" such as Cas9 has expedited gene drive research tremendously, showing the potential of this approach to genetically alter or suppress wild populations of insect pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>CRISPR/Cas, which refers to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein, was originally derived from the immune systems of bacteria and archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s><s>In cells, Cas9 DNA endonuclease bound with a small single guide RNA (sgRNA) is guided to a specific target sequence through base pairing between the sgRNA and DNA.</s><s>Once the target is recognized, Cas9 binds to its sequence and promotes DSBs.</s><s>CRISPR/Cas9-based homing gene drive systems have been demonstrated in a wide range of organisms including yeast <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>, mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, and the mosquito disease vectors A. gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, A. stephensi <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, and Aedes aegypti <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>The systems typically contain three elements, a Cas9 gene driven by a promoter active in the germline, one or more sgRNA genes controlled by a U6 gene promoter, and a fluorescent protein marker gene to monitor biased inheritance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>The gene drive cassette is flanked by homologous sequences or "arms" that match the gene sequences to either side of the Cas9 cleavage site <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Given their potential to spread, recommendations have been made for improved biocontainment of gene drive strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>One suggested approach is to test and evaluate gene drives as a "split" homing gene drive in which the Cas9 and sgRNA components are present at widely separated locations in the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Resistance development is one of the major challenges to develop an efficient gene drive system.</s><s>This could simply occur due to naturally occurring allelic variants present in a population that are resistant to Cas9 cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>Resistance can also arise as a consequence of DNA repair.</s><s>In addition to HDR, the DSB at the homology site can also be repaired through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end joining pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Mutations within the sgRNA target site can prevent further Cas9-mediated cleavage, resulting in resistant-allele accumulation and loss of drive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>For example, a gene drive in A. gambiae was initially very successful, but the accumulation of short deletion mutations in the sgRNA target sequence that were resistant to Cas9 cleavage and restored functionality of the encoded protein led to drive resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>More complex gene drive designs have been employed to minimize drive failure due to resistance.</s><s>For example, using multiplexed sgRNAs along with a recoded rescue element targeting a haplolethal RpL35A gene, Champer et al have observed up to 91% of drive inheritance in D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As population growth will largely be determined by female productivity, gene drives targeting a gene required for female development or reproduction could be particularly effective for population suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>.</s><s>Drive males would be viable and fertile and thus pass on the disrupted female-essential gene to their offspring.</s><s>Among insects, the sex-determining genes involved in sexual development and differentiation are functionally conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and have been exploited to develop genetic control methods of pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>The bottom of the sex determination pathway in dipteran species such as D. melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata, and Musca domestica is quite conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>The female-specific protein transformer (TRA) combines with non-sex-specific proteins (TRA2 and RBP1 in D. melanogaster) to regulate the sex-specific alternative splicing of doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru) gene transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>.</s><s>In D. melanogaster, the TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex binds to multiple sites in the 3′UTR of the female dsx transcript and enhance the use of a weak splice acceptor (SA) that immediately precedes the female exon <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>In the absence of the TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex in males, this weak SA site is ignored, and instead, the common exon is spliced to a male-specific exon that is downstream of the female exon.</s><s>The sex-specific DSX F and DSX M isoforms control the proper sexual and somatic tissue differentiation in a developing fly <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s><s>As the female exon is highly conserved and essential for DSX F function, it was a suitable target for a homing drive.</s><s>At the laboratory scale, Kyrou et al. have shown a complete population suppression with a homing gene drive targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene in A. gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>The sequence matching the sgRNA spanned the intron-female exon boundary and was invariant among several Anopheles species.</s><s>Drive-resistant alleles did not accumulate suggesting strong functional constraint on the targeted sequence.</s></p><p><s>We have been interested in developing genetic strategies for control of the invasive fruit pest Drosophila suzukii.</s><s>A native of Asia, D. suzukii is now present in North America, Europe, and parts of South America <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s><s>Unlike most Drosophila species that are not economic pests, D. suzukii females have a serrated ovipositor that facilitates egg laying in ripe fruit before harvest <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</s><s>While farmers mostly rely on insecticides for control, use is weather dependent, resistance has been reported to spinosad and pyrethroids in California <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>, and a wide range of noncrop host plants can provide a refuge <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>.</s><s>Area-wide genetic control strategies offer an attractive species-specific alternative for control of this pest.</s><s>The sterile insect technique (SIT) has been used successfully for area-wide suppression of some pests for over 70 y <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>.</s><s>In an SIT program, a large excess of sterile males (at least 10:1) is repeatedly released over the targeted area.</s><s>For implementation of SIT for control of D. suzukii, methods for mass rearing and for sterilization have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>.</s><s>A recent study found that repeated releases of sterile males led to significant suppression of a field population of D. suzukii <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>.</s><s>Kandul and colleagues used the pgSIT approach to generate sterile D. suzukii males <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>This required crossing Cas9 and sgRNA strains that produced offspring with Cas9-mediated loss-of-function mutations in genes essential for female survival and male fertility.</s><s>Repeated releases of sterile males (3 to 5:1 release ratio) into lab cage populations led to effective population suppression.</s><s>We recently developed fsRIDL D. suzukii strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref> that produce only males when reared on diet without tetracycline.</s><s>We showed that repeated releases of an excess of fsRIDL males (3 to 10:1 release ratio) led to suppression of small cage populations of D. suzukii.</s><s>While effective, implementing SIT, pgSIT, and fsRIDL control programs across a large area would likely be expensive because of the need to repeatedly release an excess of sterile or modified males.</s><s>As homing gene drive offers a potentially much more efficient population suppression approach for control of D. suzukii <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>, here we have developed and evaluated a CRISPR/Cas9-based split homing gene drive that targets the female-specific exon of dsx.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>dsx Female-Exon Disruption Causes Dominant Female Sterility in Most but Not All Lines.</s><s>The dsx female-specific exon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) is highly conserved in the genomes of wild-type D. suzukii collected across the United States and several other locations in Europe and South America (64) (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Six sgRNAs were evaluated using an in vitro DNA cleavage assay with recombinant Cas9 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>One of the most effective, dsx-sgRNA3, was selected for the homing gene drive construct.</s><s>The selected target is well conserved across D. suzukii genomes (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>The dsx homing cassette (6.1 kb) consists of dsx homology arms, an U6:3 promoter-dsx-sgRNA3 gene, and a constitutively expressed DsRed selection marker gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>The U6:3 promoter was from D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref> and was used previously to express a white sgRNA in D. suzukii <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>.</s><s>The sgRNA targets Cas9 to the dsx female exon to induce a DSB 52 bp downstream from the start of the exon.</s><s>Following microinjection of the dsx homing construct and Cas9 protein precomplexed with the dsx-gRNA into precellular embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68)</ref>, four independent homing strains were established at a transformation rate of about 9% (Dataset S1).</s><s>All of the transgenic G 1 females that had a single copy of the dsx homing transgene were sterile with the exception of two out of the six females obtained from the 1C G 0 parent (Dataset S1).</s><s>Consequently, the homing lines have been maintained by crossing transgenic males with wildtype virgin females each generation.</s><s>To further investigate sterility, hemizygous females were crossed with wild-type males, and the proportion that produced offspring was recorded.</s><s>Hemizygous 1C2 female fertility was comparable to wild type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), but fecundity was reduced (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>However, hemizygous females from the other lines were fully sterile (i.e.</s><s>dominant sterility) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) and did not lay eggs (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Morphologically, the dominant sterile females appeared to be very similar to wild type with a serrated ovipositor that allows the pest to lay eggs in ripe fruit (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Further, upon dissection, the ovaries appeared to contain developing eggs, although the ovaries were often smaller than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>All homozygous 1C2 flies were intersexual but could be separated morphologically as male-like or female-like (SI Appendix, Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2-S5</ref>).</s><s>Molecular analyses with PCR primer pairs for X-linked (yellow) and Y-linked (DsPp1-Y2) genes showed that the male-like and most of the female-like intersex flies were genetically male (XY) and female (XX), respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10 A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that the reason 1C2 hemizygous females were fertile but females from the other initial drive strains were sterile was because of nucleotide differences that somehow influence the splicing of dsx exon 2 to the male exon.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we initially amplified and sequenced a 6.7-kb region from the transgene to the male exon.</s><s>However, very few nucleotide differences were found between the drive strains and none that were unique to 1C2 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, we next examined a 1.07-kb region upstream of the transgene that included the common exon 2 and part of the first intron.</s><s>In this region, there were a few nucleotide differences between the 1C2 strain and the sterile strains, mostly within the first intron (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hemizygous Females Express the dsx M Transcript.</s><s>We next examined whether any of the females from the homing strains produce the male-specific dsx M transcript.</s><s>Reverse transcriptase PCR and 3′RACE-PCR analyses showed that the hemizygous females from the dominant female sterile lines produce both the male and female transcripts, but 1C2 females only make the female transcript (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1  E</ref> and <ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>In addition, 3′ RACE analysis identified a shorter transcript in females from all lines that appears to use a cryptic polyadenylation signal in the U6:3 terminator (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</s><s><ref type="figure">E-G</ref>).</s><s>RT-PCR with primers to detect the dsx M , dsx F , and dsx SA transcripts in hemizygotes.</s><s>(E) Transcripts that include the male exon.</s><s>In wild-type controls, the dsx M transcript is only detected in RNA from males.</s><s>The dominantly sterile females of lines 3A3, 15A2, and 30B1 all showed dsx male transcript expression.</s><s>Females from the 1C2, and the dsx SA homing strains (23AI1, 6CT1, 42BI1, and 49BI1) did not show any detectable dsx M transcript.</s><s>Males from all lines produce the dsx M transcript.</s><s>1C2 females and males also produce the dsx M, C2 splice product (E, blue arrowhead).</s><s>(F) Transcripts that include all

U1 , yellow) and males (green, dsx M2 ; red, dsx U1 ; cyan, dsx U1, C2 ; pink, dsx U1SA ).</s><s>(G) In the dsx SA homing strains, males and females produce the dsx SA transcript, which uses the myosin splice acceptor site to join exon 2 with the HA tag exon.</s><s>A minor unspliced product dsx SA1 was also detected.</s><s>See SI Appendix, Tables <ref type="table">S7</ref> and <ref type="table">S8</ref>, for details of alternatively spliced transcripts.</s><s>Blue arrows indicate locations of RT-PCR primers.</s></p><p><s>All strains produce the female dsx F transcript (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>However, this analysis also detected a minor splice variant that was present in all sterile strains but not 1C2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>This transcript was produced through joining of the exon 2 splice donor site with a cryptic SA site in the D. melanogaster polyubiquitin promoter (reverse strand), which is part of the PUb-DsRed marker gene (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>).</s><s>Malelike (XY) 1C2 homozygotes did not produce the dsx M transcript (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10C</ref>).</s><s>However, a related transcript, dsx M.C2 , which is similar to dsx M but has an extra copy of exon 2, was identified (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>).</s><s>The extra copy of exon 2 is in-frame and would encode a protein identical to DSX M but with a duplication of the 46 amino acid domain encoded by exon 2 (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>).</s><s>These molecular analyses show that the female-exon knock-in disrupts splicing of dsx transcripts.</s></p></div>
