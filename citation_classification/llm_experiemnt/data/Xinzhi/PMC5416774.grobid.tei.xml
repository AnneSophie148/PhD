<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>There were no dramatic differences between the localized search responses of WCR larvae exposed to any of the corn lines tested; however, the rootworm larvae consistently demonstrated a ranging behavior after contact with the filter paper and oats, indicating that they did not recognize the controls as hosts.</s><s>This was expected since larvae exposed to germinated oat roots had showed a ranging behavior in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Strnad and Dunn 1990)</ref> and oats may contain a larval feeding deterrent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Branson and Ortman 1969)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Binning et al. (2005)</ref> conducted assays that were somewhat similar to the current experiment, except that in their experiment they exposed the insects to artificial diet (modified after <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pleau et al. 2002)</ref> with and without Cry34/35Ab1 proteins.</s><s>They concluded that Cry34/35Ab1 was perceived as a poor host for WCR larvae.</s><s>However, the factors responsible for host recognition require specific extraction techniques if they are to be separated from corn <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bernklau et al. 2009)</ref>, and these factors are likely not present in artificial diet.</s><s>In addition, Cry proteins are tied up in plant cells under normal circumstances and not directly available to searching larvae as was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Binning et al.(2005)</ref>.</s><s>Contact cues associated with the roots are the driving factor of host recognition <ref type="bibr">(Branson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ortman 1969, Strnad and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dunn 1990)</ref>, and this study demonstrates that each corn type, Bt, RNAi, the vector stack, and isoline, contains sufficient contact cues to elicit a localized search response by both Cry3Bb1 resistant and susceptible larvae when the larvae are removed from the germinated corn roots.</s><s>The toxins present in the Bt/RNAi roots did not significantly affect the host response despite what may have happened in other Bt assays such as in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clark et al. (2006)</ref>.</s><s>Phenological differences in the corn may play a role in this discrepancy since corn seedlings of a slightly younger age were used in this study.</s></p><p><s>Overall the data between the two sets of assays were similar with the primary difference being the addition of a paired resistant colony.</s><s>Although the susceptible colony had significantly less host recognition patterns than the resistant colony on RNAi, the susceptible colony never reached the level of ranging behaviors that was demonstrated by larvae exposed to the controls.</s><s>The same is true for the resistant colony on the isoline corn roots compared to the susceptible.</s><s>The differences observed in the response levels of resistant and susceptible neonates to RNAi but not RNAi Ã¾ Bt suggest that the Bt provides more of a contact cue when coupled with RNAi than when RNAi is used alone.</s><s>Alternatively, the RNAi may interfere with the contact cues needed to produce a stronger recognition response by the larvae when used alone.</s></p><p><s>Contact cues in the isoline root as perceived by the resistant larvae may not be as strongly perceived as the in the susceptible larvae or perhaps there is a slight difference in contact cue chemical composition.</s><s>In the current set of assays, although differences were detected between colonies, overall all corn lines were recognized as suitable hosts.</s><s>In RIB fields, the WCR would be attracted to these hybrids, presumably feed, then be exposed to the Bt toxins or RNA in the roots the same as the isoline plants.</s><s>Neonates did not perceive isoline as a nonhost over Bt or RNAi hybrids therefore equal larval pressure could be expected on Bt, RNAi, and the isoline plants in a refuge in a bag field, which is positive for resistance management strategies as it helps hinder resistance development.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1.</s><s>The total distance moved (A), maximum distance from origin (B), velocity (C), turn angle (D), and meander (E) of the western corn rootworm larvae in 5 min after exposure to a different plant seedlings or filter paper for experiment one.</s><s>Letters indicate significant differences between corn types (P 0.05).</s><s>Analysis was done with square root transformed data; figures represent untransformed data.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
