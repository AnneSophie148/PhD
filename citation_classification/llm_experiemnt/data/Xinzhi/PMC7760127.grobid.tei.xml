<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The huanglongbing (HLB, also known as citrus greening) is currently considered the most destructive disease to the citrus industry and is present in most of the citrus-growing areas of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In North America, HLB is associated with the bacterial phytopathogen, "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus", and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama.</s><s>The symptoms of HLB include blotchy mottle of leaves, yellow shoots, off-season bloom, stunting, misshapen and bitter fruit, and fruit drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Since the initial discovery of D. citri in Florida in June 1998, the infection rate of HLB in citrus groves has significantly increased up to 100% in some parts of the state, and has significantly reduced the citrus production in infected areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, no cure exists for HLB and its management mainly depends on the control of its insect vector using insecticides.</s><s>Unfortunately, the heavy use of insecticides for the control of D. citri can cause several critical problems such as insecticide resistance, residues in food products and environmental pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, effective and environment-friendly pest management strategies would reduce the cost of citrus production and minimize the use of insecticide.</s></p><p><s>Most of citrus cultivars including sweet oranges, grapefruits and Pummelo (C.</s><s>maxima) are susceptible to "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus", however, field observations indicated that some citrus varieties are tolerant to "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus" bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Besides, controlled greenhouse studies confirmed that some citrus varieties such as Citrus latipes and Eureka lemon (C.</s><s>limonia Osbeck) were more tolerant to the "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus" pathogen than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In the same manner, field and greenhouse observations suggested that D. citri has specific host plant preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>For instance, field observations indicated that Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack (orange jasmine) and sweet orange were more preferred hosts by D. citri than Poncirus trifoliata <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, no-choice assays demonstrated that P. trifoliata and its hybrids were tolerant to D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The authors suggested that P. trifoliata have both antixenosis and antibiosis resistance to D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, Tsai and Liu showed that grapefruit was a more preferred host for D. citri than sour orange, rough lemon and orange jasmine <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The life cycle of D. citri is related to the growth pattern of its host plants, and psyllid mainly mates, lays eggs and develops on fresh young shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>It is also known that D. citri is attracted to bright yellow and green colors, which are indicative of young shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In terms of olfactory cues, previous studies suggested that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by flushing shoots could play an important role in the attraction of D. citri to its host plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In our previous study, we found that juvenile leaves produced more sesquiterpenes than mature leaves, whereas mature leaves produce more monoterpenes than juvenile leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>These results indicated that the ratio of monoterpenes/sesquiterpenes could be an important factor in the attraction of D. citri to its host plants.</s><s>To understand why some citrus varieties are more tolerant to "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus" than others, we investigated the volatile and non-volatile profiles of several citrus cultivars with different degrees of tolerance to "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus" pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While the spread of HLB has been destructive to the citrus industry, it encouraged the citrus breeding programs to screen the entire field germplasm collection to identify selections with tolerance to this disease.</s><s>Some tolerant selections have a direct cultivar potential, but other selections should be hybridized with complementary parents to achieve commercialization.</s><s>Additionally, other selections could serve as new rootstock, trap plants or windbreaks.</s><s>Recently, several new hybrids have been developed and released in Florida including "Sugar Belle", "Bingo" and "411".</s><s>Fortunately, some of the newly released hybrids like "Sugar Belle" showed good tolerance to HLB disease in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Advances in chromatography and mass spectrometry allow the detection and quantification of many polar and semipolar metabolites.</s><s>Metabolomics has been widely used in different animal and plant species, and it is believed that there are about one million metabolites in the plant kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, a new research area using metabolomics was initiated, ecometabolomics.</s><s>This field focuses on the use of metabolomics in ecology to understand species' interaction with the environment and with other organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we investigated the metabolomic profiles of three new hybrids and their parents using GC-MS to explain the attraction of D. citri to those plants.</s><s>The new hybrids were produced from the cross of C2-5-12 Pummelo (C.</s><s>maxima (L.) Osbeck) × pollen from C. latipes.</s><s>C. latipes has a compact architecture and is known for its tolerance to HLB <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, whereas Pummelo (C.</s><s>maxima) generally makes large trees and is sensitive to HLB and is considered a good host for D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Crossing between Pummelo and C. latipes could result in new hybrids that are tolerant to "Ca.</s><s>L. asiaticus" and/or its vector, which could be useful in the management of the HLB disease as citrus windbreak and trap tree.</s></p></div>
