<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p><s>We obtained a georeferenced database of 78,000 D. citri panel trap collection sites in Southern California from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Program (CPDPP) via the Citrus Research Board (CRB) from 2008 through 2014.</s><s>Detection records were obtained from 14 x 23 cm double-sided yellow panel traps that were positioned in parts of 10 counties (Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, San Diego, and San Luis Obispo) [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(30)</ref> for a detailed description of the trapping database].</s></p><p><s>We developed three indicators of "grove-level" characteristics, including: (1) grove area, (2) grove edge, and (3) grove perforation.</s><s>Grove area was calculated as the size of each commercial citrus grove in square meters using a commercial citrus grove (definition from 26) layer (obtained from the CRB) in ArcGIS v. 10.2.</s><s>Given that the number of traps varied with the size of the grove, we expect to find an area effect in the analyses, and therefore use it in part to minimize confounding effects on the estimation of other variables in the models.</s></p><p><s>Because there is a biologically plausible mechanism by which an "edge effect" in citrus groves can impact insect abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(34)</ref> and disease transmission risk (23), we used the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT v2.0) to quantify grove edge and grove perforation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Grove edge was calculated as the proportion of citrus tree pixels within 100 meters of the citrus grove/noncitrus grove outside edge.</s><s>Grove perforation was calculated as the proportion of citrus tree pixels along the edge of small clearings found within groves.</s><s>Together, these landscape metrics characterize the extent to which citrus groves are fragmented and are therefore an effective proxy for quantifying the edge effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(36)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We developed two indicators of "urban landscape-level" characteristics surrounding groves, including: (1) urbanization intensity, and (2) proximity to transportation corridors (i.e., distance to roads).</s><s>Urbanization was calculated as the proportion of both treeless cover and impervious surface within 100 m of each grove:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[(100% -% Tree Cover) + % Impervious Surface]<label>2</label></formula><p><s>This produced an index of urbanization intensity ranging from 0 (low urbanization) to 100 (high urbanization).</s><s>Proximity to transportation corridors was calculated as the minimum distance between groves and the nearest road designated for commercial truck traffic by the California Department of Transportation (available from <ref type="url" target="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/gis/datalibrary/">http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/gis/datalibrary/</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we developed a set of indicators to measure the "neighbor effect" to more mechanistically capture spatial linkages stemming from urban influences.</s><s>We included measures of distance to urban or peri-urban D. citri detections to capture any spillover from urban environments, and distance to D. citri detections in other citrus groves to capture grove-to-grove spillover.</s><s>Due to strong year-to-year collinearity among distances to urban D. citri detections and among distances to D. citri grove detections, we grouped neighbor effect indicators into two temporal phases relative to when D. citri detections in urban areas and in groves started to become common <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Our indicators of neighbor effect included: (1) early-phase <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> distance between citrus groves and nearest residential citrus detection (i.e., "urban early-phase"), (2) late-phase (2012-2014) distance between citrus groves and nearest residential citrus detection (i.e., "urban late-phase"), (3) early-phase (2011-2012) distance between commercial citrus groves and nearest commercial grove detection (i.e., "grove early-phase"), and (4) late-phase <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref> distance between commercial citrus groves and nearest commercial grove detection (i.e., "grove late-phase").</s><s>An initial principal components analysis supported grouping the neighbor effects in this manner (MP Daugherty, unpublished data).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>We used two sets of analyses to identify the factors related to D. citri: (1) the invasion rate of commercial citrus groves (i.e., why some groves were invaded more quickly than others), and (2) the cumulative number of D. citri detections in all invaded groves as a proxy for the potential impact of this invasive vector (i.e., why some groves have more repeat detections than others).</s><s>Cumulative detections were calculated as the total number of traps in a grove, to date, that collected at least one D. citri (i.e., total number of traps with D. citri present).</s><s>We adopted this approach, instead of using explicit D. citri counts on each trap, due to concerns about inconsistency in reporting counts versus simply reporting D. citri presence absence.</s><s>Prior to analysis, all grove, landscape, and neighbor effects were standardized by converting them to z-scores.</s><s>This standardization is important to ensure that the different units in which the variables were measured (e.g., grove area [m 2 ] vs. urbanization [0-100%]) did not bias the model fitting and selection process in favor of particular variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(37)</ref>.</s><s>All analyses were conducted using the R programming language (v.</s><s>3.6.1).</s></p><p><s>For the analysis of invasion rate, we developed a pair of Cox proportional hazard models, which are semi-parametric tests often used to test "time-to-event" data that includes multiple variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(38)</ref>, to discern the effects of grove-level variables in an urban landscape-level context from that of neighbor effects that capture spillover pressure [(39); coxph() in R].</s><s>The first model evaluated the effects of grove-level characteristics (i.e., grove area, grove edge, grove perforation) and urban landscapelevel (i.e., urbanization intensity, distance to roads) variables on the rate at which commercial groves incurred their first D. citri detection.</s><s>Because the distance to roads variable did not meet the proportional hazards assumption, an interaction with time was included in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Next, to capture more mechanistically the effects of potential spatially dependent drivers of invasion rate, a second model evaluated effects of grove-level characteristics and neighbor effects [i.e., grove earlyphase (2011-2012); urban early-phase (2008-2011); grove latephase (2013-2014); urban late-phase (2012-2014)] on invasion rate.</s><s>Due to collinearity with some of the neighbor effects, the urban landscape-level effects were not included in the second model.</s><s>For both models, we fit different formulations with all possible combinations of the 5 or 7 unique variables.</s><s>The different model formulations were then ranked via Akaike Information Criterion [AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(41)</ref>] to identify one or more best-supported models, which we define as falling within five AIC units (i.e.</s><s>AIC &lt; 5) of the highest ranked model (i.e.</s><s>lowest AIC value).</s><s>Finally, we used model averaging with shrinkage [model.avg() in package MuMLn; Bartoń, (42)] of the best-supported models to estimate the effect size and 95% confidence interval for each variable represented in at least one of the best-supported models.</s><s>In the event that a single model substantially outperformed the others, we evaluated the significance of individual terms with a series of likelihood-ratio tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(38)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unlike invasion rate, cumulative number of D. citri detections in a citrus grove is a proxy measure of vector impact, stemming from effects of vector density or frequency relative to hosts on disease outbreaks (43).</s><s>We used a similar approach to analyze the effects of grove-level characteristics, urban landscape-level context, and neighbor effects on the cumulative number of grove detections (i.e.</s><s>number of D. citri positive traps) for the approximately 500 groves that had at least one detection.</s><s>Due the count nature of cumulative detections, and high frequency of groves with a low number of observed detections, they were analyzed with a pair of generalized linear models with negative binomial error <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(38)</ref>.</s><s>As before, one set of models analyzed grovelevel characteristics and urban landscape-level context variables and a second analyzed grove-level characteristics and neighbor effects.</s><s>In addition, each set of models included an effect of time since infestation (i.e., number of months since the first D. citri detection in that grove) to control for some groves being first invaded much (i.e., up to 3 years) earlier than others.</s><s>Again, we fit all possible combinations of variables within each set of models, ranked those models using an information-theoretic approach, and used model averaging to estimate the effect size of coefficients in the best-supported models.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Cross-habitat spillover of organisms is increasingly gaining recognition, particularly in agroecosystems and urban forests.</s><s>Many studies have focused on the movement of organisms between agricultural habitats and natural habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s><s>Unlike these studies, our research addresses the less familiar spillover between urban and agricultural habitats within an anthropogenic-dominated landscape, and its importance for the spread and impact of an invasive insect pest of high economic significance.</s><s>In our study area, citrus constitutes a substantial fraction of urban tree plantings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(29)</ref>.</s><s>D. citri was first recorded in these urban micro-habitats (such as house backyards and gardens) of southern California in 2008.</s><s>Within three years, D. citri had invaded commercial citrus groves <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Overall, our results highlight the role of grove-level factors in combination with two spatially-explicit factors, namely urban landscape-level context and neighbor effects in modulating urban-agricultural spillover.</s></p><p><s>At the grove-level, grove area stood out as a common factor affecting both rate of invasion and magnitude of D. citri infestation such that large groves were invaded faster and also contained greater cumulative detections of D. citri.</s><s>These results are not surprising given that, as noted earlier, trap number varied grove size.</s><s>Yet, part of the observed effect may also be attributable to larger plantings of citrus trees acting as larger targets for D. citri invasion.</s><s>A similar 'magnetic effect' has been reported among mass flowering crops wherein pollinators tend to spillover in large numbers during blooming periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">44)</ref>.</s><s>After controlling for grove area, the proportion of citrus along grove edges and the extent of grove perforation only affected the rate of invasion.</s><s>In both cases, a higher proportion of grove edge and grove perforation increased the rate of invasion.</s><s>Studies have similarly shown that the amount and ecological nature of the edge, and consequent edge-effects, are often important drivers of spillover from groves to natural habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Citrus trees at the outer edge of groves have been shown to contain a higher abundance of D. citri compared to trees in the interior, particularly those groves on the exterior edge of large farms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, grove edge and grove perforation had no significant effect on the cumulative number of D. citri detections in a citrus grove, perhaps indicating that once a grove is invaded local recruitment is an important element of D. citri population dynamics.</s><s>Studies have shown that resource availability and abundance can affect population growth and eventual abundance of organisms that spillover into high quality recipient habitats such as mass flowering crops plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Both urban landscape-level variables, distance to major roads and urbanization intensity, had significant effects on the rate of D. citri invasion.</s><s>The distance to roads had an overall negative effect on the rate of spillover during early stages of invasion, but then shifted toward a positive effect in more recent years.</s><s>Urbanization intensity increased the rate of invasion, implying that citrus groves surrounded by higher levels of urbanization are more quickly invaded by D. citri.</s><s>Taken together, the positive effect of urbanization intensity on rate of invasion suggests heavily disturbed urban-grove edges, along with the distance to roads, can facilitate introduction pathways and hasten D. citri invasion.</s><s>Distance to major roads tends to result in greater D. citri abundance within groves, which again suggests the role of roads in serving as introduction pathways and potentially affecting multiple introductions of D. citri individuals from the surrounding landscape.</s><s>An earlier study on the initial D. citri detections within urban Los Angeles identified major roads entering the city as a likely introduction pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(31)</ref>.</s><s>In the only other study known to us, proximity to anthropogenic edges such as roads was found to enhance parasitic attacks of a leaf miner in suburban woodland fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr">47)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating urban landscape-level factors in spillover studies.</s></p><p><s>Studies have shown that cross-habitat spillover can influence community dynamics of the recipient habitat through processes such as predation, parasitism, and disease transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>While grove-level characteristics set the risk threshold for invasion, neighbor effects suggest that proximity to D. citri invaded neighborhoods are the eventual deterministic factor driving the spillover.</s><s>In this respect, it is important to note that the early-phase distance to nearest urban occurrence (urban early-phase) and late-phase distance to nearest grove occurrence (grove late-phase) are negatively related to the rate of invasion.</s><s>In other words, there appear to be strong spatial linkages between urban occurrences of D. citri and its arrival in nearby groves, and among groves once one of them is invaded.</s><s>The relatively sporadic presence of citrus host plants in urban micro-habitats can initiate the urban-grove spillover, which suggests the need for more spatially comprehensive management plans that take into consideration the potential role of surrounding landscape.</s></p><p><s>The strong effects of early-phase urban and late-phase grove invasion implies that the spillover pressure from D. citri invasion is most pronounced after spreading substantially in the surrounding landscape.</s><s>In a recent spillover study, the magnitude of bee spillover from mass flowering citrus groves to nearby woodland patches was similarly found to vary in both space and time, such that spillover was not only higher in woodland patches in landscapes with high cover of mass flowering citrus groves but was particularly higher after the citrus blooming period <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(44)</ref>.</s><s>The study further demonstrated that the observed spillover dynamics are largely driven by variation in flower cover across the landscape, and hence is considered to be resource-mediated.</s><s>Our findings point to a similar resource-mediated mechanism behind the spillover but with the striking difference that the movement of D. citri individuals were initially from relatively resource-poor urban conditions to resource-rich groves.</s><s>Overall, the neighbor effects suggest that spillover of D. citri is not merely a function of spatial proximity to nearest invaded grove and/or urban location but is also shaped by the temporal trajectory of D. citri invasion.</s></p><p><s>To mitigate the impact of the D. citri invasion in Southern California, a strategic plan was implemented that included monitoring for D. citri and CLas, removal of infected trees, the release of biological control agents, a residential insecticide treatment program, restrictions on the movement of plant material, and community outreach <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">48)</ref>.</s><s>Despite this, urbanto-agriculture spillover occurred within the first few years of the southern California invasion.</s><s>This observed early-phase effect of urban invasion suggests D. citri spillover into citrus groves was initially driven by D. citri from citrus plantings in urban and peri-urban locations in close proximity to groves.</s><s>Later citrus grove invasions were driven largely by spillover from nearby invaded groves, which suggests that the source of D. citri spillover into citrus groves shifts over time.</s><s>This apparent shift in spillover dynamics has implications for management of D. citri and similar insect pests that are not   restricted to a single habitat type.</s><s>Specifically, for areas where the invasion is at an advanced stage, such as in Southern California, attempts to mitigate further D. citri spread into commercial citrus will likely benefit more from management of invaded groves than from measures focused in residential areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">48)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, in areas where D. citri is not as well-established, such as the Central Valley of California ( <ref type="formula">49</ref>), given competing demands on resources, our results indicate mitigating future D. citri invasion of groves is likely to benefit most from management in urban areas.</s><s>Meanwhile, attempts to mitigate further spread of CLas and huanglongbing may require different strategies.</s><s>Given that to date all of the ∼1,500 documented cases of huanglongbing in California have occurred in residential citrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(33)</ref>, and within cumulative counts of D. citri in groves indicating a continuing influx from urban areas, concentrating vector control and inoculum reduction programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(27)</ref> in urban areas is likely to be more impactful than in commercial citrus.</s><s>In other words, development of appropriate management strategies requires a recognition of the fluid nature of invasion dynamics and careful consideration of the specific management objectives.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
