<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Acyrthosiphon pisum virus (APV) is an unclassified picorna-like positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that infects the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>The approximately 10-kb genomic RNA is polyadenylated and contains two long ORFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The 5' ORF (ORF1) is predicted to encode the nonstructural proteins since its product contains canonical motifs for helicase, protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains.</s><s>Purified virions contain proteins with estimated masses of approximately 66, 33, 24 and 23 kDa, where the most abundant protein, 33K, is estimated to occur at 5-to 10-fold excess relative to the other capsid-associated proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The genomic regions encoding the capsid proteins have been partially mapped via Edman degradation of five internal peptides.</s><s>Unusually, the 33K and 23/24K proteins map to the 3' end of ORF1 while the 66K protein maps to both the 3' end of ORF1 and the 5' half of ORF2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>); thus the 66K protein is a transframe protein.</s><s>The presence of canonical motifs (a U_UUA_AAC slippery site and 3'-proximal predicted RNA stem-loop structure; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in the short region where ORF1 and ORF2 overlap, strongly suggests that the mechanism by which the 66K transframe protein is produced is ribosomal frameshifting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Kelp fly virus (KFV), another unclassified picorna-like virus, was described in 1976 and its genome sequence was reported in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The virus has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of ,11 kb, that contains a single long ORF whose product contains canonical motifs for helicase, protease and RdRp domains, encoded within the 3' approximately two thirds of the ORF.</s><s>Structural proteins VP1 and VP2 (see below), and a predicted inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-like domain, are encoded within the 5'-terminal one third of the ORF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>VP1 was observed to bear similarities to the APV structural proteins, in particular in the N-terminal one third (which corresponds to the APV 33K protein).</s><s>Virions are 2961 nm and have high buoyant density (1.42560.002</s><s>g/ml) in neutral CsCl <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Further analysis revealed the presence of two major structural proteins with sizes ,75 kDa and ,29 kDa in the approximate ratio 1:5, besides a minor VP1-related product of ,16 kDa, and a minor product that was slightly smaller than the 75 kDa product.</s><s>Edman degradation precisely mapped the N-termini of the VP1 and VP2 structural proteins, and mass spectrometric analysis mapped internal peptides.</s><s>Cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction revealed an icosahedral structure with turrets at some of the 12 five-fold vertices, though on average only ,25% of five-fold vertices were estimated to be occupied by turrets.</s><s>Based on volumetric calculations, the capsid shell was proposed to comprise 60 copies of an asymmetric unit comprising a protein or proteins of approximately 75 kDa, while the turret domain was estimated to comprise a unit of approximately 70 kDa.</s><s>It was proposed that VP1 might represent the turret domain, with a footprint in the shell, while the bulk of the shell might comprise VP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) infects the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>SINV-3 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of ,10.4 kb.</s><s>The genomic RNA is polyadenylated and contains two long ORFs.</s><s>The product of the 5' ORF contains canonical motifs for helicase, protease and RdRp domains, but the structural proteins had not been mapped, nor had the identity of the protein or proteins encoded by ORF2 been determined.</s><s>SINV-3 was observed to bear amino acid sequence similarity to KFV in the helicase, protease and RdRp domains, although the two viruses are nonetheless highly divergent.</s><s>SINV-3 was also observed to bear similarity to KFV in particle morphology, with icosahedral 27.361.3</s><s>nm virions with apparent surface projections and high buoyant density (1.3960.02</s><s>g/ml).</s></p><p><s>In contrast to APV, KFV and SINV-3, members of the family Caliciviridae infect vertebrates.</s><s>Caliciviruses have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes typically of ,7.5-8.5 kb, and have not yet been assigned to an order.</s><s>Viral RNAs are polyadenylated and bear a 5'-covalently linked protein, VPg, acquired via its role as a protein primer for the viral polymerase (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</s><s>Unlike picornaviruses, caliciviruses have short 5' UTRs without internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements and VPg plays a role in ribosome recruitment.</s><s>The non-structural proteins are encoded within a long ORF covering the 5'-proximal approximately two thirds of the genome, while the major capsid protein (VP1) and a small basic protein (VP2) are encoded within two 3'-proximal ORFs.</s><s>VP2 is a minor component of the virion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The nonstructural proteins are translated from the genomic RNA, while VP1 and VP2 are translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), where translation of VP2 depends on a terminationreinitiation mechanism: due to special signals within the mRNA, a proportion (estimated to be ,5-20%) of ribosomes that have terminated after translating VP1 are then able to reinitiate on the VP2 initiation codon and translate VP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in some genera (e.g.</s><s>Lagovirus and Sapovirus), the VP1 ORF is contiguous with the nonstructural polyprotein ORF, so that some VP1 is also translated from the genomic RNA as a fusion with the nonstructural polyprotein, even though VP1 is also translated from the sgRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Further, in at least one species where these ORFs are not contiguous, some VP1 is translated from the genomic RNA via termination-reinitiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Thus it has been proposed that there may be a selective advantage in producing a small amount of capsid protein early in infection, and indeed VP1 has been shown to enhance RdRp activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Virions have T = 3 symmetry and comprise 180 copies of VP1 and perhaps 1 to 8 copies of VP2.</s><s>VP2 is thought to be located inside the virion and appears to be involved in virus assembly and stability  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The N-termini of the KFV structural proteins VP1 and VP2 have been mapped via Edman degradation; the C-terminal extent of VP2 is estimated from its gel mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The calicivirus structural proteins VP1 (tan) and VP2 (olive green) are expressed from a sgRNA.</s><s>The N-terminal part of VP1 contains a picorna-like jelly-roll fold shell (S) domain ('JR'; bright green), while the C-terminal part comprises a protruding (P) domain.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093497.g001</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>The N-terminal approximately one third of VP1 contains a picorna-like jelly-roll fold shell domain (S), while the Cterminal approximately two thirds comprises a protruding domain (P); P and S are connected by a flexible hinge.</s><s>The S domains form the virion shell while the P domains form protrusions on the virion

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Sequence analysis suggests that APV expresses its structural proteins from a subgenomic RNA Although the APV genome was published in 1997, it was not until 2009 that the genome of a second closely related virus, Rosy apple aphid virus (RAAV), was published <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>RAAV has the same genome organization as APV and retains the U_UUA_AAC frameshift site in the ORF1-ORF2 overlap region.</s><s>The two viruses share on average 87% amino acid identity.</s><s>We analyzed the degree of nucleotide conservation between APV and RAAV at synonymous sites using techniques described previously (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Regions of enhanced conservation at synonymous sites are indicative of overlapping functional elements -either coding or non-coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>The analysis revealed a number of regions of enhanced conservation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>A region of conservation immediately 3'-adjacent to the frameshift site corresponds to the predicted frameshift-stimulatory RNA stem-loop structure in APV <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, that is also preserved in RAAV.</s><s>A region of conservation at the 3' end of ORF2 may correspond to replicational elements as such features are common in this genomic location in many RNA viruses (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, high synonymous site conservation was also observed some distance upstream of the 3' end of ORF1, covering an extended region between the RdRp-and capsid-encoding regions of ORF1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Previously we and others have observed similar patterns of conservation in alignments of, for example, calicivirus sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In those genera where the nonstructural polyprotein and VP1 ORFs are fused (e.g.</s><s>Lagovirus and Sapovirus), a prominent peak in synonymous site conservation marks the junction between the sequence encoding the nonstructural polyprotein and the sequence encoding VP1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, panels 1 and 2).</s><s>The enhanced conservation presumably reflects the requirement for the sequence in this region to simultaneously encode protein and contain sgRNA promoter elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In some cases, translation enhancer elements on the sgRNA may also contribute to increased synonymous site conservation.</s><s>Similarly, in Murine norovirus (genus Norovirus, genogroup GV), where the nonstructural polyprotein and VP1 ORFs are separate, there is enhanced synonymous site conservation at the 3' end of the nonstructural polyprotein ORF, starting from ,200 nt upstream of the sgRNA start site (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, panel 4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In several calicivirus species, an additional accessory protein is encoded by a short ORF overlapping the 5'-proximal region of the VP1 ORF.</s><s>In Murine norovirus, an ORF of ,213 codons in this location encodes a virulence factor, VF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of this ORF leads to an extended region of synonymous site conservation in the corresponding part of the VP1 ORF (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, panel 4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Group I sapoviruses are also thought to harbour an overlapping ORF in this genomic location (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, panel 3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>Such accessory ORFs are thought to be translated, along with VP1, from the sgRNA via leaky scanning mechanisms (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These observations suggest an explanation for the region of synonymous site conservation in APV and RAAV -namely that it corresponds to a promoter sequence for producing a sgRNA from which the structural proteins could be expressed, and possibly also one or more overlapping ORFs from which accessory proteins might be translated from the same sgRNA.</s><s>This proposal correlates well with the observation of a sub-genome length (4kb) RNA by Northern blot analysis using a probe to nucleotides 4959-10016 of the APV genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The 4-kb RNA was found to be more abundant than genomic RNA in APV-infected aphids but less abundant in purified virions.</s><s>Van der Wilk et al. postulated that the 4-kb RNA could be either a sgRNA or a defective interfering RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>(The latter explanation seemed attractive because the 4-kb RNA also weakly hybridized to a 5'-terminal cDNA clone, and also because the capsid protein could be expressed from the genomic RNA so a sgRNA seemed superfluous.)</s><s>Because only five internal peptides were mapped by Edman degradation, it is not known precisely where the region of APV ORF1 that encodes the structural proteins begins.</s><s>Remote homology searches (HHpred, Phyre 2) map amino acids 1526-2093 of the ORF1 polyprotein to the RdRps of members of the picorna-like virus superfamily (including the families Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae).</s><s>Similarly, amino acids 2417-2602 of the ORF1 polyprotein map to picorna-like jelly-roll fold capsid proteins.</s><s>Thus, if the structural proteins are translated from a sgRNA, then translation on the sgRNA would be expected to begin in the region of codons 2093-2417 of ORF1.</s><s>Enhanced synonymous site conservation, which might represent a sgRNA promoter element, appears to begin at around codon 2079 of ORF1.</s><s>The first available AUG codon for structural protein translation initiation downstream of this site is at ORF1 codon 2154 (strong context, G at -3 and G at +4; APV genomic coordinates 6727-6729).</s><s>Initiation here on a sgRNA would lead to the synthesis of a 53-kDa polypeptide for non-frameshift translation.</s><s>This is somewhat larger than the 33K virion protein observed by van der Wilk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, suggesting that the polypeptide may be N-terminally cleaved, perhaps to release a predicted dsRNA binding protein (dsRBP) domain ('*' in Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>; see also below) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>By analogy to Murine norovirus and group I sapoviruses, the extended nature of the conserved region between APV and RAAV suggests that it may represent not just a sgRNA promoter, but also one or more overlapping genes.</s><s>An inspection of the positions of stop codons in the +1 and +2 reading frames relative to ORF1 revealed the presence of two consecutive ORFs (X1, X2) in the +1 reading frame that together cover most of the 3'-extent of the conserved region (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>ORFs X1 and X2 begin, respectively, at the first and third AUG codons on the predicted sgRNA (APV genomic coordinates 6716-6718 and 6968-6970), while the second AUG codon is in the ORF1 frame and is the likely initiation site for structural protein synthesis as mentioned above (APV genomic coordinates 6727-6729).</s><s>The first AUG codon has a weak context, thus allowing for leaky scanning, at least to the second AUG.</s><s>These AUG codons are conserved also in RAAV, as is the absence of other intervening AUG codons.</s></p><p><s>Thus we propose a model for APV in which (i) an sgRNA is produced and (ii) the structural proteins, and potentially two accessory proteins encoded by overlapping ORFs X1 and X2, are translated from the sgRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>Together, these hypotheses would explain the unusual region of conservation in the APV-RAAV alignment.</s><s>Although these hypotheses were not experimentally tested in this work, the comparative genomic analysis of APV and RAAV is relevant to our experimental analysis of SINV-3 (below), a species for which limited sequence data (just two closely related sequences) currently precludes a similar comparative genomic analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SINV-3 utilizes ribosomal frameshifting in the expression of its structural proteins</head><p><s>As described above, the SINV-3 genome contains two long ORFs, with the product of the 5' ORF containing canonical motifs for the helicase, protease and RdRp domains, but the structural proteins have not been previously mapped.</s><s>Interestingly, blastp analysis revealed similarity between the C-terminal end of the SINV-3 ORF1-encoded polyprotein (downstream of the RdRp motifs) and the N-terminal one third of the KFV VP1 capsid protein, and also the 33K capsid protein of APV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Sequence similarity between KFV VP1 and APV structural proteins has been previously noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Analysis with both HHpred and Phyre 2 further revealed that the C-terminal approximately 194 aa of the SINV-3 ORF1 polyprotein maps to the canonical eight-stranded b-barrel (jelly-roll fold) capsid shell proteins of picornaviruses and caliciviruses ('JR' in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Similar to APV, HHpred also predicted a dsRBP domain ('*' in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) just upstream of the jellyroll domain.</s><s>The similar genomic location in SINV-3 and APV of the sequence encoding the jelly-roll domain suggested that SINV-3 might, like APV, encode a capsid extension within ORF2 and use ribosomal frameshifting to express the extension as a fusion with the ORF1-encoded capsid protein.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with this hypothesis we observed that, although the first ORF2-frame AUG codon is some 474 nt 3' of the ORF1 stop codon, the maximal (stop-codon-to-stop-codon) ORF2 extends far upstream and in fact overlaps the 3' end of ORF1 in the -1 reading frame.</s><s>The overlap between ORF1 and the extended ORF2 comprises just the sequence U_GAU_UUA_AAC_UGA (underscores separate ORF1 codons).</s><s>This sequence contains a canonical slippery heptanucleotide for -1 frameshifting, namely U_UUA_AAC, the same slippery sequence that is present in APV and RAAV <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To test the frameshifting hypothesis, we obtained polyclonal Abs to various 14-aa predicted antigenic peptides in the Cterminal end of the ORF1 product and in the ORF2 product (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>).</s><s>SINV-3 virions were purified and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western analysis and Coomassie staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>).</s><s>Ab-VP1a, raised against a peptide in the jelly-roll domain encoded within the 3' end of ORF1, recognized four products in purified virions, with masses approximately 77, 28, 26 and 23 kDa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>), with the 28 kDa product giving the strongest signal, and the 77 kDa product giving the weakest signal.</s><s>Ab-VP1b also recognized 28, 26 and 23 kDa products, but with lower sensitivity, and, consistent with this, the 77 kDa product was not detected with this Ab.</s><s>The low mass products are consistent in size with termination at the ORF1 stop codon, encompassing the jelly-roll domain (,21 kDa) and flanking polypeptide sequence.</s><s>We collectively call these products VP1.</s><s>The reasons for the mass differences between these related products remain to be investigated and may involve posttranslational modifications, cleavage (e.g. during virion maturation), or degradation during sample preparation.</s><s>Moreover the relative abundances of the different VP1-related products was observed to vary between different sample preparations (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>).</s><s>It is worth recalling that three low mass VP1-related products (33K, 24K, 23K) were also observed for APV, again with the most massive being the most abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Ab-FSD recognized a product of ,77 kDa but no products of lower mass.</s><s>Assuming that Ab-VP1a and Ab-FSD recognize the same 77 kDa product in purified virions, then this product must correspond to a transframe fusion (orange hatching in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>) as expected from the ribosomal frameshifting hypothesis.</s><s>We call this product VP1-FSD, where 'FSD' stands for 'Frame Shift Domain'.</s><s>The mass of
