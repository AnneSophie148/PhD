Resistant Citrus genotypes may prevent the colonization or multiplication of D. citri, but some of them are not close to commercial quality.</s><s>Therefore, it has become important to find relatively easy alternative control strategies that are as effective as synthetic pesticides but are safer for the farmers, consumers, and environment and are cost effective.</s><s>One of the possible alternatives would be the use of pesticides or insect repellents of plant origin, as from Citrus genotypes resistant or less preferred hosts for D. citri.</s></p><p><s>Essential oils from plants generally are active as insect attractants or repellents.</s><s>Although the mechanisms of action of insect repellents may differ greatly and are often not yet well understood, they have the advantage of combining a wide range of toxic potencies, thereby reducing the chance of pests developing resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, residues are hardly expected on the products or in the environment because essential oils are generally non-persistent under field conditions, as they are readily degraded by light and oxygen into less toxic products.</s><s>Brazil is in a good position to develop and utilise plant-derived essential oils because this country has a rich biodiversity of Citrus species.</s></p><p><s>Borgoni and collaborators evaluated eight genotypes of Citrus and related genera ('Pera', 'Natal', and 'Washington Navel' oranges (C.</s><s>sinensis), 'Marsh Seedless' grapefruit (C.</s><s>paradisi), hardy orange 'Rubidoux' (Poncirus trifoliata), kumquat (Fortunella margarita Swingle), citrumelo 'Swingle' (C.</s><s>paradisi ˆP.</s><s>trifoliata), and citrange 'Troyer' (P.</s><s>trifoliata ˆC.</s><s>sinensis)) by determining whether they influence oviposition of D. citri in no-choice tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The experiments were performed in greenhouses with plants grafted onto 'Rangpur' lime (C.</s><s>limonia) and placed individually in cheesecloth cages.</s><s>'Rubidoux' (P.</s><s>trifoliata) was the least preferred genotype for oviposition; reduced number of eggs was also found on citrange 'Troyer', while 'Marsh Seedless' was the genotype with the most eggs.</s><s>Considering all of the evaluated parameters, it was concluded that cultivars of sweet orange are the most susceptible genotypes to D. citri.</s><s>Regarding oviposition, P. trifoliata 'Rubidoux' showed resistance of the antixenosis type.</s></p><p><s>Diaphorina citri female oviposits and develops exclusively on new shoots; thus, its life cycle is closely tied to the growing pattern of its host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Some studies have shown that stimuli emitted by new shoots may play an important role in the detection, location, and evaluation of potential host plants by Asian Citrus psyllid.</s><s>We have now examined the essential oil of new shoots from the eight genotypes of Citrus cited above in order to determine if compounds present in the oil explain the preference of D. citri to sweet orange cultivars and non-preference to P. trifoliata 'Rubidoux' for oviposition.</s><s>However, the overall aim of this study was to identify potential volatile compounds of 22 genotypes of Citrus, which could be used to develop olfactory lures for enhancing D. citri detection and monitoring, as well as to identify effective repellents from plants.</s></p></div>
