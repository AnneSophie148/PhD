<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is a plant virus characterized by its doublestranded RNA genome.</s><s>It belongs to the family Reoviridae and falls under the genus Fijivirus.</s><s>RBSDV is primarily known for its ability to infect various plants within the Gramineae family, such as rice, maize, barley, and wheat.</s><s>This viral infection poses a considerable threat to agricultural crops in East Asia, resulting in substantial yield losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>RBSDV is primarily spread by a specific insect called the small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén).</s><s>This transmission occurs on rice plants and is persistent and circulative in the wild.</s><s>The virus is transmitted when the SBPH feeds on the phloem tissues of both Viruses 2023, 15, 2127 2 of 14 infected and healthy rice plants.</s><s>However, it should be noted that transmission of RBSDV does not occur through the eggs of the planthopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>RBSDV-infected plants exhibit characteristic symptoms including severely dwarfing with leaves that are notably darkgreen.</s><s>Additionally, there maybe a distinct appearance of white waxy or black-streaked swelling, predominantly observed along the veins on the undersides of the leaf blades and sheaths.</s><s>Furthermore, these infected plants also experience a significant decrease in seed fertility, displaying an alarming decline in reproductive capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Since the 1990s, an outbreak of the disease occurred in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other Provinces in China, especially in 2010, when the disease rate in severely affected areas exceeded 50%, resulting in a sharp decline in the yield of rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Once infected by RBSDV, there is almost no therapeutic method application for farmers.</s><s>Additionally, RBSDV can also cause Maize rough dwarf disease and Green dwarf disease of wheat and other viral diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, this requires that the producer could detect the virus at the early stage, and take action quickly.</s></p><p><s>RBSDV genome is composed of ten linear double-stranded RNAs, named according to their migration speed on gel electrophoresis, from slow to fast, S1 to S10, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The genome-wide sequence of the virus consists of 29,141 bp nucleotides, which contains thirteen open reading frames (ORFs), and encodes a total of thirteen proteins, including six structural proteins, such as P1, P2, P3, P4, P8 and P10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>One particular protein of significant importance is the RBSDV P10 protein, which serves as the principal outer capsid protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>This protein is frequently employed as a marker for RBSDV infection during disease diagnosis due to its relatively higher levels of expression in infected tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to identify and detect RBSDV, several methods have been established previously.</s><s>These techniques include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Northern blotting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID-ELISA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, RT-loopmediated isothermal DNA amplification (RT-LAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and single small brown planthopper RT-PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>However, these detection methods require professional technicians to operate and are relatively high cost.</s><s>In addition, there are few reports on methods for simultaneous large-scale detection of RBSDV in rice seedlings and SBPH in the field, such as the monoclonal antibody-based antigen-coated-plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>However, other polyclonal antibody-based serological methods and other more accurate assays for large-scale detection of both hosts (rice and SBPHs) in the wild are still lacking.</s><s>Therefore, there is an urgent need for an RBSDV-specific, sensitive, high-throughput and easy to operate method to detect and manage RBSDV in the wild.</s></p><p><s>In our research, we utilized the prokaryotic expressed His-CP RBSDV as an antigen to immunize rabbits and successfully obtained potent polyclonal antibody titers against the His-CP RBSDV protein (PAb-CP RBSDV ).</s><s>Using the PAb-CP RBSDV , a variety of serologybased detection methods for RBSDV-infected rice seedlings and SBPHs were established.</s><s>Furthermore, the present research suggests that the utilization of a blend of both RT-PCR and Western blot methods holds potential for the accurate identification of RBSDV in rice seedlings and SBPHs.</s><s>Furthermore, this work presents a new method named S-RT-LAMP which combines PAb-CP RBSDV -based immunoprecipitation with RT-LAMP.</s><s>Based on S-RT-LAMP, we can directly and exactly detect RBSDV-infected rice seedlings and SBPHs simultaneously at a large-scale.</s><s>Our study provided more RBSDV positive detections as it is based on the specific antibody followed by nucleotides amplification, which will detect faster than traditional detection and is beneficial for taking controlling-actions by farmers in an early stage of RBSDV infection.</s></p></div>

target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>As a result, we have explored the possibility of using this protein with His-tag to produce an antiserum for serological diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the His-CP RBSDV was purified (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>) and used as an antigen to immunize rabbits.</s><s>Then, the crude antiserum against His-CP RBSDV was then obtained (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Then, the titer of crude antiserum was certified, and Western blot and dot-blot were used to test the quality of the antiserum using the purified His-CP RBSDV as an antigen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>After purification of the PAb-CP RBSDV from the crude serum, we developed multiple serology-based methods for specific detection of RBSDV in two hosts with the polyclonal antibodies (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>).</s><s>Despite the existence of various RBSDV antibodies that have been created and utilized for the identification of RBSDV in SBPHs and rice plant tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of the precise potency of the developed antibodies against RBSDV in each detection method that has been employed.</s><s>Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAb-CP RBSDV were evaluated to determine the optimal titer, as well as specificity, for detecting RBSDV in the hosts.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we successfully developed Western blot, dot blot, ELISA, and RT-PCR detection methods utilizing the PAb-CP RBSDV that we prepared.</s><s>This polyclonal antibodybased serological approach can identify more epitopes than methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies for detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, allowing for a more efficient diagnosis of RBSDV in SBPH and rice seedling samples.</s><s>It is worth noting that we identified the ideal titer of the prepared PAb-CP RBSDV for rice seedling detection methods to be at a 10 4 -fold dilution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we used laboratory-prepared PAb-CP RBSDV and PAb-CP RSV for the simultaneous detection of rice and planthopper infected with either RSV or RBSDV, and the results also showed that the P10 antiserum prepared in this experiment was highly specific and significantly different from RSV for the detection of RBSDV in rice and SBPHs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>).</s><s>Hence, we used the ELISA method to specifically detect rice samples infected by RBSDV and RSV which can also sensitively detect these two viruses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>The findings indicated a strong correlation between Western blot, dot-blot, RT-PCR, and ELISA techniques when used together, enabling a convenient and precise detection of RBSDV in both rice seedling samples and SBPHs found in natural environments.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we developed and optimized a method named S-RT-LAMP, which combines RT-LAMP with PAb-CP RBSDV for the detection of RBSDV infected plants and insects.</s><s>This study determined that total RNA isolated from products obtained by immunoprecipitation of infected RBSDV rice or SBPH with PAb-CP RBSDV at 63 • C could be detected within only 60 min by RT-LAMP.</s><s>During processes of total RNAs and protein extraction, CP RBSDV might protect its genomic RNAs or viral transcripts via directly binding in cellular disruption condition.</s><s>Hence, the S10 RNA here is more stable than that of direct total RNAs extraction.</s><s>Furthermore, our method demonstrated remarkable sensitivity, surpassing that of the RT-PCR technique, as it successfully detected RBSDV in total RNA extracts up to 1.1 µg per reaction.</s><s>This level of sensitivity highlights the superior capabilities of our approach in detecting the presence of RBSDV.</s></p><p><s>The key describable features of this S-RT-LAMP assay were: (1) we first used the prepared specific antibodies to immune-precipitate viral proteins (CP RBSDV ) from plants and planthoppers, which ensures that the proteins packaged with viral RNA are directly isolated from the large amount of disrupted cellular components by immune-precipitation using PAb-CP RBSDV , which greatly avoided the degradation of the RNA S10 by RNase and improved the purity and quality of the samples for detecting viruses; (2) and then we combined RT-LAMP to achieve a large number of amplification efficiency under a short-term constant temperature conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>, row 1).</s><s>Given that the reaction takes place under isothermal conditions at the ideal temperature, there is no time delay due to temperature fluctuations, similar to what is commonly observed in PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>(3) Additionally, there were many reports describing the use of RNA as an RT-LAMP template in one tube <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In our S-RT-LAMP, we employed crude purified RNAs that specifically bind to the CP RBSDV .</s><s>This approach effectively mitigates the occurrence of false positives that may arise from contamination of the reaction product due to frequent lid opening.</s><s>(4) Finally, with SYBR Green I used as the fluorescence indicator, the detection results could be directly judged by observing the color changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>, row 2).</s><s>In addition, fluorescence changes can also be observed under UV light conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>, row 3).</s></p><p><s>Based on the detection methods described above, the newly developed S-RT-LAMP was more suitable for direct and accurate detection of RBSDV on rice and SBPHs in the wild field in the present study.</s><s>Our results of S-RT-LAMP possesses great potential in application for the field detection of RBSDV.</s><s>Although there are certain complexities in the experimental process of S-RT-LAMP, due to its more
