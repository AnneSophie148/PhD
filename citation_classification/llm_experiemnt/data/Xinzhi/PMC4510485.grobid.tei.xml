<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Evaluation of resistance to RBSDV.</s><s>An antibiosis test showed that the average survival rates of SBPH on Wuyujing No. 3, Huaidao No. 5 and Tetep were higher than the survival rate on IR50, with a highly significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that Wuyujing No. 3, Huaidao No. 5 and Tetep did not exhibit antibiosis.</s><s>In the non-preference test, the average number of SBPH on each single seedling varied among the four rice varieties, and there was a significant difference between IR50 and Huaidao No. 5.</s><s>In contrast, no significant difference was observed between IR50 and Tetep (P &lt; 0.05), which demonstrated that Tetep had a weak non-preference.</s><s>Therefore, Tetep likely has weak resistance to SBPH.</s></p><p><s>The results of dot-ELISA revealed that the rates of infection of SBPH with RBSDV were 27% and 35% from plants grown in the experimental farms of the Institute of Jianhu Agricultural Sciences (JH) and the plant protective station of Guanyun (GY) in Jiangsu Province, respectively.</s><s>Because the total numbers of SBPH were 7.9 × 10 6 and 6.9 ×10 6 per hm 2 in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , the effective inoculation amounts were 2.13 × 10 6 and 2.42 × 10 6 per hm 2 in JH and GY, respectively.</s><s>Based on 3 ×10 5 plants per hm 2 , there were likely to be approximately 7 and 8 SBPH per plant in JH and GY, respectively.</s></p><p><s>The incidences of disease on Huaidao No. 5 were 77.1% and 78.7% in the field test and artificial inoculation test, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which indicated the accuracy of the evaluation methods.</s><s>The incidences  of disease on Tetep were found to be 12.5% and 13.7% using the field and artificial inoculation test, respectively, these values are significantly lower than those for Huaidao No. 5. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the results of two methods, demonstrating the accuracy of the artificial inoculation test and also indicating that the resistance of Tetep is mainly due to resistance against RBSDV.</s></p><p><s>Phenotypic analysis of the progeny of the cross between Tetep and Huaidao No. 5.

target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , and several "hot spot" regions on chromosomes 3 and 11 were  identified.</s><s>These results suggested that rice might have developed multiple mechanisms of resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf disease during the long-term co-evolution among the virus, the plant and the vector.</s><s>Because a field test was the only method used for phenotypic analysis in the above reports, the resistance mechanisms of the identified genes have not yet been clarified, i.e., it is not known whether rice plants are resistant to SBPH, RBSDV or both.</s><s>This lack of information has slowed the progress of breeding programs.</s><s>In our previous study, we developed an artificial inoculation identification method for evaluating the RBSDV resistance level of rice varieties after overcoming three obstacles: interference from southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) due to similar symptoms, the preservation of the virus sources used for the artificial inoculation identification, and interference from rice stripe virus (RSV), which can be transmitted to offspring through the ovary <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The resistance loci identified in this study were verified as RBSDV resistance genes using the artificial inoculation identification, which was verified based on the results of the resistance analysis in Tetep.</s><s>qRBSDV-3, which was identified in this study, is located in a hot spot on chromosome 3 that contains genes conferring resistance to RBSDV or SBPH, including qRBSDV3, qRBSDV3a, qRBSDV3b, qSBPH3-a and Qsbph3d <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>By comparative mapping using common DNA markers, qRBSDV-3 was found to be close to the region harboring qRBSDV3b, which also harbors Qsbph3d and qSBPH3-a.</s><s>However, qRBSDV-3 and qRBSDV3b are not the same locus, as they are mapped to different regions.</s><s>In addition, Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> reported that qRBSDV3b is only involved in SBPH resistance.</s><s>Additionally, qRBSDV3a <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and qRBSDV3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , which mapped to the same region, are quite distant from qRBSDV-3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that qRBSDV-3 in our study is a new QTL that only confers resistance to RBSDV.</s></p><p><s>qRBSDV-10 mapped to the short arm of chromosome 10 in our study.</s><s>By comparative mapping using common DNA markers, portions of qRBSDV-10 were found to overlap with the region of qSTV10 that confers RSV resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>qRBSDV-11 is located on the long arm of chromosome 11, however, qRBSDV11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and another two loci reported to confer RBSDV resistance 11 mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11.</s><s>Thus, qRBSDV-11 is a new QTL found in this study.</s><s>To date, some major QTLs for rice stripe disease resistance have also been identified on chromosome 11, such as qSTV11-f, stv-b i and qStv11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>According to the comparative mapping analysis, qSTV11-f 20 and qStv11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> were localized to the same region as qRBSDV-11 in this study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>The loci responsible for resistance to different types of pathogens or pests are thought to be clustered in specific chromosomal regions in many organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr"

.</s><s>Indeed, many reports have demonstrated that the region described above is a hot spot for genes that confer resistance to diseases, including rice blast, rice bacterial leaf blight and rice stripe disease, or pests, including Nephotettix cincticeps, Nephotettix virescens and SBPH.</s><s>These data indicate that this region might play an important role in the co-evolution between plants and parasites, thus, more attention should be devoted to this region in resistance breeding programs.</s></p><p><s>Unlike regular pests, SBPH acts as a transmission vector and causes plant loss by spreading viruses other than directly attacking.</s><s>Thus, the identification of RBSDV resistance genes becomes more urgent to reduce yield loss from SBPH attacks, which are currently occurring throughout China.</s><s>In this regard, loci that only confer resistance to the virus, such as those discovered in this study, could be more effective and can be further improved by fine mapping to identify tightly linked markers.</s><s>These markers can be used in marker-aided selection aimed at developing cultivars that are resistant to rice black-streaked dwarf disease.</s></p></div>
