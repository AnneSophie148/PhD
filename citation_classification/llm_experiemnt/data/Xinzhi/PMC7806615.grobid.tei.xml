however, during host plant habitat colonization by herbivorous insects, the amount of resources for feeding and reproducing is a major factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> affecting habitat selection.</s><s>Later, when an initial population is present in maize fields, no secondary MRDV infections occur, the infected plants are randomly distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , and field size is not significantly related to virus incidence in fields planted late.</s></p><p><s>The population patterns of L. striatellus flights on maize were similar in the two study years and affected the seasonal occurrence of this insect reported previously in Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In addition, these authors reported that the variation in virus incidence was mostly a function of a few viruliferous insects that are required during the early developmental stages of a crop.</s><s>These results suggest that a higher virus incidence was registered in fields sown later and corresponded mostly to vector migration for the colonization of maize in comparison with the low number of insects caught in March, April and May.</s><s>As expected, the abundance of vectors in alfalfa fields or orchards was much lower than that in maize.</s><s>However, despite the low number of vectors in orchards, the virus incidence in the later planting period was positively related to insect catches in orchards and in maize in that period.</s><s>Clemente-Orta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> reported that the abundance of L. striatellus was related to the proportion of orchards in the landscape in the late season.</s><s>It is known that different crop management techniques in the agroecosystem affect the pattern of vector abundance and vary between years, especially for overwintering adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The non-detection of MRDV in any of the analysed weeds confirms the reduced number of alternative hosts of this virus as well as their reduced susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Most of the grasses found to be infected in these studies were summer or late-spring grasses, as sampling was performed in very late spring or summer, while our sampling was conducted when summer grasses were rather scarce, and sampling was focused on the most abundant grasses.</s><s>On the other hand, the non-detection of MRDV may be due to the number of samples analysed; therefore, future analyses would have to be carried out with a more sensitive method.</s><s>In this context, the results obtained using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach confirmed that Avena spp. is a host of MRDV (unpublished data).</s></p><p><s>The results obtained in this study show the effect of surrounding crops and their management on the epidemiology of MRDD.</s><s>We report that higher incidences were observed in the late planting period, and the effects of the main variables implicated in the MRDV incidence varied with planting period.</s><s>In addition, the strong influence of maize planting period on MRDV incidence, vector abundance, grass plant cover at the edges and the proportion of winter cereals/fallow in the landscape are the main factors involved in the epidemiology of MRDV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The contribution of the factors that determine virus incidence strongly depends on the crop planting period.</s><s>In the early planting period, the presence of edges is the main factor to consider, while in the late planting period, the increase in vector abundance increases the risk of infection.</s><s>In addition, our results show that L. striatellus numbers are related to MRDV in the late planting period, which has not been previously reported in our area and is in contrast to the results of Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> but consistent with the results of Conti <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>The patterns of the movement and abundance of the species in agricultural landscapes are highly complex (temporal and spatial), and this complexity hinders the interpretation and comparison of these parameters among studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> ; thus, this aspect should be studied more thoroughly in future research.</s></p><p><s>These results contribute to our knowledge of influence crop management practices on MRDV incidence and could be considered when selecting planting periods to minimize the virus incidence in maize crop areas.</s><s>Finally, a number of recommendations could be issued from this study to minimize the risk of infection by MRDV, which is responsible for substantial losses in maize production in our area:</s></p><p><s>(1) Late maize planting periods should be avoided as much as possible to minimize the risk of infection by MRDV; from this perspective, March and April could be suitable planting months.</s><s>(2) Simultaneous planting of maize fields in the vicinity of winter cereals should be avoided as much as possible, especially in cereal harvesting periods.</s><s>(3) The application of herbicides at edges could be optimized to minimize the grass cover in both the planting period and the first stage of crop development.</s><s>Grass species act as sources of the viral inoculum and as breeding and feeding vectors.</s><s>However, it should be considered that edges can also be a reservoir of natural enemies that colonize maize fields and prevent outbreaks of insect pests.</s></p></div>
