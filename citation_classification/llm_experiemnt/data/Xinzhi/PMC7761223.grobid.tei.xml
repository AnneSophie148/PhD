<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Rice orange leaf disease (ROLD) was first reported in the Philippines in 1960 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The causal agent-rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP)-was identified in 1987 based on insect transmission tests and by electron microscopy observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Another phytoplasma species, which causes a disease in rice called rice yellow dwarf phytoplasma (RYDP) has been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasma belongs to a family of bacteria that is unculturable in vitro.</s><s>Taxonomically, phytoplasma belongs to the class Mollicutes, and has been classified within the genus "Candidatus Phytoplasma" based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Presently, molecular analysis of conserved genes, particularly the 16S rRNA gene, is used for the detection, identification, and classification of phytoplasmas by conventional and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The ROLP isolates from the Philippines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and India <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> were shown to belong to the 16SrI "Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris" group, based on the abovementioned technical scheme.</s><s>The ROLP isolate was further classified in the aster yellows subgroup (Candidatus Phytoplasma sp.</s><s>AY 16S-group, AY-sg) phytoplasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Typically, mature rice plants infected with ROLP showed moderate stunting and the appearance of a golden or orange leaf coloration that initiates at the tip and then progresses downward, followed by an inward rolling of leaves and eventually leading to leaf senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>However, the symptoms vary depending on plant conditions and stages, such that the leaves of infected plants show yellow to golden or yellow to deep orange coloration, tiller numbers are slightly to severely reduced, plant height is slightly to severely stunted, and growth habits display erect or spreading phenotypes.</s><s>Yield is seriously affected due to the poor growth and reduced tillers of plants.</s><s>At the seedling stage, it is often lethal when the plant is severely infected <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>The insect responsible for its spread is the zigzag-striped leafhopper, Recilia dorsalis Motchulsky (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), also known as Inazuma dorsalis, and for a long time this species was recognized as the only insect vector that transmits ROLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Recently however, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> reported that ROLP was also transmitted by another insect species, the green leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in South China, therefore suggesting much broader infection routes of ROLP in Nature than previously thought.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, RYDP reported in rice-growing countries of East and Southeast Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> causes general chlorosis of leaves and severely stunted profuse tillers, which are distinct symptoms from ROLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>RYDP is transmitted by green leafhopper species, including N. virescens Distant, N. cincticeps, and N. nigropictus Stål (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, which also transmit rice dwarf virus that causes rice dwarf disease (RDD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, as well as the rice tungro disease (RTD)-associated viruses, namely rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref>.</s><s>Symptoms of RDD are also distinct from ROLD and its occurrence in the Philippines is confined only in Midsayap, North Cotabato <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but it has also been reported in Japan, China, and Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> RTD is reported to occur in Asian tropics and N. virescens is the most efficient vector of the tungro disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, it is known that RTD-associated tungro viruses develop symptoms similar to those caused by ROLP infection in rice, such as golden-or orange-colored leaves.</s><s>Therefore, it often causes confusion at a field level, especially when the rolled senescent leaves have not yet manifested.</s><s>This might lead to misdiagnosis of ROLD and RTD in many rice-cultivating countries and might be a reason for few reports of ROLD in the early 21st century.</s><s>In the past decade, however, ROLD has become a reemerging rice disease as it caused field devastation affecting rice yields in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Vietnam <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since the last domestic report of ROLP in 1987 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, there have been no reports concerning severe damage caused by ROLD in the Philippines.</s><s>In 2017 and 2019, however, rice plants with yellowing symptoms similar to those of RTD and ROLD were observed at the experimental paddies of the International Rice Research Institutes (IRRI) in Laguna and Mindanao provinces, Philippines.</s><s>Moreover, the occurrence of N. virescens is higher in these rice fields than the ROLP vector-R.</s><s>dorsalis.</s><s>In this study, the occurrence of ROLP in paddies in the Philippines and possible transmission of ROLP by an alternative insect species were investigated.</s><s>The results shed light on the increasing importance of ROLD in Southeast and East Asia.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">ROLD Prevalence and Field Symptoms</head><p><s>Based on field observation, a portion of rice plants in Laguna showed the typical aforementioned ROLD symptoms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, in Mindanao, rice plants showing ROLD-like symptoms were sporadically distributed in the rice fields (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), while some exhibited tungro-like symptoms that were difficult to distinguish.</s><s>Indeed, ROLP symptoms varied depending on the fields cultivated, variety, and age of the plant, as previously mentioned.</s><s>In this field survey, all the ROLD-suspected rice plants, particularly in Mindanao showed a wide range of symptoms, which include a rice plant with severe stunting, reduced tillers, and orange-colored leaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>); a plant with golden to deep orange leaf discoloration and an inward leaf rolling, which are typical orange leaf disease symptoms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>); and a plant with severe stunting, reduced tillers, and drying of leaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>By nested PCR, 81.7% (49 out of 60) collected in 2017 and 94.7% (36 out of 38 samples) collected in 2019 in Laguna and Mindanao, respectively, were ROLP-positive (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, most ROLD-suspected rice plants observed in these provinces are considered to have shown symptoms due to the ROLP-infection.</s><s>Because some of these symptoms are similar to those of RTD, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RTBV and RTSV were conducted.</s><s>The results showed that no infection of RTBV and RTSV (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), thus it is highly expected that the ROLP induced several symptoms in the paddies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transmission of ROLP by N. virescens</head><p><s>Since there is no record of N. cincticeps occurrence in the Philippines, N. virescens was suspected to be an alternative vector of ROLP.</s><s>The 60 groups of three insects (20 groups per ROLP-source) were examined for their acquisition of the agent using three ROLP-infected plants (S-1, S-2, and S-9: described as ROLP or disease source) and for the transmission ability to young rice seedlings (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>After all acquisitions, inoculations, and periods for symptom development, live seedlings were taken into account, while dead seedlings were excluded (maximum at 160 tested seedlings per disease source) to evaluate the transmission based on symptom observation.</s><s>Infected Taichung Native 1 (TN1) seedlings from the transmission test were slightly stunted and showed leaves with discolored and poor growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>As a result, 10.6% seedlings (49 out of 464) exhibited symptoms after two weeks from the completion of inoculation access period (IAP) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After 15 days from the initiation of the ROLP acquisition (5-days AAP to 10-days serial IAP), insects were harvested and analyzed for the maintenance of ROLP in their bodies.</s><s>Nested PCR revealed that 45.0% (27 out of 60 groups of three insects) of the tested insect groups were positive for ROLP, suggesting that almost half of the groups have acquired and maintained the pathogen for at least a week by 5-days acquisition access period (AAP) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Note that this detection rate varied between disease-source plants (13, nine, and five groups per 20 groups, respectively).</s><s>Moreover, not all ROLP-positive insect groups induced symptoms on inoculated seedlings: 74.1% (20 out of 27) showed symptoms, while 25.9% (seven out of 27) showed no symptoms on inoculated seedlings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>None of the randomly selected asymptomatic leaves from the transmission test were ROLP-positive.</s><s>Similarly, no symptoms were observed on inoculated seedlings with insects that fed on the control-healthy plant source in the AAP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), therefore, ROLP-detection was negative in insects and seedlings.</s></p></div>

despite successful SCWLP-detection in the insect vector, Yamatotettix flavovittatus Matsumura (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), the inoculated plants did not show any disease symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The authors inferred that the incubation period of 8 weeks from IAP may be relatively too short to observe the plant symptoms.</s><s>In this study, N. virescens were given a 16-23 days incubation period (5-days AAP, 10-days incubation, and 1-to 8-days IAP) and rice plants were given uniformly 15 days (1-day IAP and 14-days incubation), which coincides with the reported incubation time in R. dorsalis (15-33 days) and in rice plant (10-28 days) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, in India, ROLP was undetected in N. virescens collected in the phytoplasma infected rice fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Failures in the transmission and detection of ROLP might correlate with the phytoplasma accumulation levels in either the source plants or insect bodies, and with relatively short incubation periods in the insect and plants; these are yet to be elucidated in detail.</s></p><p><s>We have noticed substantial differences in symptom inductions by ROLP between those observed in this study and those in previous reports.</s><s>For example, all infected TN1 seedlings obtained from serial transmission by N. virescens showed yellowing of leaves, stunting, and poor growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>However, the short, ragged and twisted leaves symptoms reported previously by Hibino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> were not observed in ROLP-infected plants from the N. virescens-mediated transmission test.</s><s>Furthermore, the diseased fields observed in this study exhibited non-typical ROLD symptoms, instead, some aspects resembled the RTD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>Symptom development may be influenced by several factors, such as the rice variety and age of plant tissues when infected with ROLP.</s><s>Duan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> observed varying symptoms on eight rice varieties that were inoculated with ROLP by R. dorsalis.</s><s>Symptoms in IR36, IR50, and FK135 included orange discoloration and inward leaf rolling, typical of orange leaves.</s><s>Symptoms in IR8, IR20, and TN1 were initially similar to those caused by rice ragged stunt virus.</s><s>The Japonica varieties Reiho and Fukumasari showed symptoms similar to those caused by rice grassy stunt virus.</s><s>IR20, IR50, and TN1 showed severe ROLP infection than IR8, IR36, and FK135.</s><s>These findings supported the different field symptoms and transmission rates observed in this study.</s><s>Furthermore, Wongkaew <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> similarly indicated that the degree of infection severity and symptom variation of SCWLP depends on soil fertility, temperature, cane sette quality, cultural practices, and the amount of phloem-colonized phytoplasma.</s><s>These factors may also be considered for further studies to clarify the symptom variations and transmission efficiencies of ROLP observed in the field.</s></p><p><s>The spread of phytoplasma-associated diseases is largely connected to insect vector transmission in the ecosystem.</s><s>For example, Flavescence dorée phytoplasma (FDP) (16SrV-C and-D) is mainly transmitted in grapevines by American grapevine leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus Ball (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), and causes grapevine yellows disease.</s><s>However, the monitoring of insect species in vineyards and surroundings revealed new potential insect vectors, such as Orientus ishidae Matsumura (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, a reasonable FDP disperse scenario in Europe was illustrated by Malembic-Maher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>: briefly, pre-existing asymptomatic FDPs in forest environments moving in and out between natural plant hosts via several insect species that have low efficacy of the pathogen transmission to grapevines, and the introduction of non-autochthonous S. titanus from North America resulted in the serious Flavescence dorée epidemics in Europe.</s><s>In this regard, ROLP was found to naturally infect maize (Zea mays) and grassy weeds (Paspalum paspaloides and Eleusine indica) in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and was confirmed to be vectored by the alternative insect species in this study, suggesting the presence of complex ecological cycle of ROLP in paddies and surroundings that may be varied based on the phytoplasma genotypes.</s></p><p><s>Altogether, this study observed the variations in the ROLP symptoms and thoroughly investigated the rate of ROLP transmission by N. virescens, also it suggests that ROLP variants or strains may have existed in Nature, thereby leading to its transmission by a new vector, N. virescens.</s><s>The high possibility of ROLP incidence in the province of Mindanao, Philippines, where rice is cultivated in large areas of land, is tantamount to post a threat in rice production.</s><s>Likewise, the varying symptoms of those ROLP-positive rice plants in the field should be further defined for reliable diagnosis and for developing effective control strategies.</s><s>Consequently, to precisely understand the threat of ROLD in Asian countries, its pathogenicity, mechanism of infection/transmission, global occurrence, and epidemiology should be further investigated.</s></p></div>
