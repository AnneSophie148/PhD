<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Flavescence dorée of grapevine (FD) is a phytoplasma-associated disease present in several European countries.</s><s>The disease has a major impact on viticulture because inflorescences and berries dry up, shrivel, and cannot be further processed.</s><s>Other symptoms include downward leaf rolling with yellowing (in white varieties) or reddening (in red varieties), leaf vein necrosis, lack of lignification, presence of black spots on the new canes, and premature leaf fall <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; on the most susceptible varieties, stunting or lack of bud break is also observed early in the season <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Plants can either be persistently infected over several years and eventually die or recover <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Phytoplasmas are phloem-obligate, nonculturable pathogens described under the provisional genus "Candidatus Phytoplasma" mainly based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny.</s><s>By definition, FD phytoplasmas (FDp) are those belonging to the 16SrV-C and -D ribosomal subgroups transmitted by the American grapevine leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus Ball <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The vector transmits FDp according to a persistent propagative modality; a long latent period, approximately one month, is required for the insect to become infectious <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The vector remains infectious for life.</s><s>S. titanus is the main vector of FDp, as it feeds and breeds on Vitis species and can transmit FDp following acquisition on either cultivated grapevine inside the vineyard or from infected, naturalized Vitis rootstock plants outside the vineyard, thus sustaining both secondary (within vineyard) and primary (from outside the vineyard) infections.</s><s>Abandoned (or untreated) vineyards and wild Vitis rootstock plants in the areas surrounding vineyards are frequently infected and represent a reservoir of both FDp and S. titanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>American Vitis spp.</s><s>do not show symptoms but are susceptible to FDp <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and are attractive host plants for S. titanus, which coevolved with them in the Nearctic Region.</s><s>Besides S. titanus, other leafhopper and planthopper species have been identified as FDp vectors, among these Orientus ishidae <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Dictyophara europaea, Allygus spp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and Phlogotettix cyclops <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>However, these latter species are polyphagous rather than grapevine feeders and are likely to spread phytoplasmas in the wild compartment and, only occasionally, transmit FDp to cultivated grapevines (primary infections).</s><s>S. titanus is regarded as the main vector associated with all the major epidemics of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>FD was first identified in the Piedmont Region of Italy in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; soon after its discovery, dramatic epidemics occurred because vector populations were not controlled, and the disease progressed rapidly because of vine-to-vine transmission within the vineyard.</s><s>Following the enforcement of compulsory control of FD, mandatory uprooting of infected plants, and insecticide applications against the vector, secondary infections were substantially suppressed.</s><s>However, over the years, a number of new infections took place, namely in the vines close to vineyard borders.</s><s>These observations suggested that the wild compartment, represented by naturalized Vitis and associated S. titanus, was the major source of infection.</s><s>To clarify the epidemiology of FD in the area, genetic tracking of phytoplasmas in the vineyard agroecosystems was carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and results showed that FD haplotypes identified in cultivated and wild Vitis, as well as in S. titanus collected inside and outside the vineyards, largely overlap, further proof of the wild compartment role in the FD epidemiology.</s><s>The comparative analysis of population level and of proportion of infected S. titanus in the cultivated and wild compartments of the vineyard agroecosystem is almost unexplored and represents essential information for management of FD.</s><s>The aim of the work is to fill this knowledge gap by conducting systematic investigations in representative sites of the Piedmont Region, where FD is a major problem for viticulture.</s><s>Our results substantially improve the understanding of the epidemiology and contribute to the design of rational and effective control programs of FD and its vector.</s></p></div>

1.2 ha) was situated at the top of a steep sloped hill and was bordered by land for livestock production to the north, a narrow forest and civic housing to the west, a dense forest to the east, and the town of Portacomaro to the south.</s><s>The western and southern edges of the vineyard were surrounded by hazelnut orchards.</s><s>Within the southwestern forest, substantial populations of wild rootstocks were found.</s><s>Both C. vitalba and wild rootstock plants were also found along the northern tree line that separated the viticultural and livestock production areas.</s><s>Visual estimates of FD prevalence at this site was about 30%.</s><s>Out of the seven sampled sites, only Castel Rocchero and Paderna were not subject to conventional chemical control of insect pests of viticulture (that includes two insecticide applications against S. titanus, the first against nymphs and the second against adults), and were managed according to guidelines for organic viticulture (based on three applications of pyrethrins in June-July).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This study was conducted under field conditions in different viticultural areas of the Piedmont Region of Italy to describe the abundance of vector populations and to estimate vector infectivity inside the vineyards and in the wild compartments surrounding the vineyards.</s></p><p><s>The selected sites were characterized by the presence of FD-infected cultivated V. vinifera, and of a wild compartment with potential alternative host plants for the FDp and its vector.</s><s>For these reasons, vector population levels and proportion of FDp-infected leafhopper do not reflect the average situation in the Piedmont Region, but rather the worst-case scenarios.</s><s>We confirmed that naturalized Vitis may host very high populations of S. titanus and that vineyards close to wild vegetation (AT, CI, LM, MO, PA, PC) or not properly treated with insecticides (CR) may also host high populations of S. titanus adults.</s></p><p><s>The highest numbers of S. titanus adults were collected with YSTs in July (likely at the very end of July), and then captures declined more or less gradually, both within the vineyards and in the wild vegetation compartment.</s><s>In most reports, S. titanus populations peak in the first half of August <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The very warm conditions of 2015 that anticipated S. titanus development (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>) and the application of insecticides in the vineyards at the end of July may explain the abundance pattern recorded in this study.</s><s>In Romania, the S. titanus adult population peaked at the end of July in the years 2009-2011 in an abandoned vineyard close to Bucharest <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, our data cannot be used to properly identify a population peak since YSTs were exposed in the fields for 20-day periods under our experimental conditions.</s><s>The pattern of population decrease over August and the beginning of September was significantly different inside and outside the vineyard (population decreased faster inside the vineyard).</s><s>The faster population decrease inside the vineyards was likely due to the insecticides applied against the adults at the end of July.</s><s>Very high numbers of adults were collected from the wild vegetation compartments, where insecticide applications are forbidden by law and the only available control measure is the difficult mechanical roguing of wild Vitis.</s><s>Based on our experience, the presence of S. titanus within an abandoned/wild area is highly aggregated, and therefore YST captures highly depended on their specific location within the wild vegetation area.</s><s>This means that our estimate of the S. titanus population levels outside the vineyards suffered from some inaccuracy.</s><s>Nevertheless, as very high captures were repeatedly obtained, together with the observations reported for Italian and North American vineyard agroecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, we can conclude that wild vegetation areas are very important sources of the vector for the nearby agroecosystems.</s><s>So far, we have no hints to explain uneven aggregated spatial distribution of S. titanus in the wild compartment.</s><s>This issue is very difficult to study, as wild compartments are very different in size, slope, orientation, and plant composition.</s><s>However, the presence of large surfaces of wild Vitis climbing on high broadleaved trees, as was the case for all the analyzed sites except CR, rather than covering the soil, is a factor that favors the presence of high S. titanus populations (personal observation).</s></p><p><s>Among the vineyards, the highest population levels were recorded at LM and CR.</s><s>In the latter vineyard, only pyrethrins were applied against S. titanus and this can account for the high population of the insect.</s><s>As for the LM vineyards, no specific factors (size of the vineyard and of wild vegetation area, slope, exposure) could be evoked to account for this high S. titanus density which is, to some extent, unpredictable.</s></p><p><s>Our GLMM model showed that a higher proportion of infected insects was recorded for the leafhoppers collected in the wild compartment compared to those from within the vineyard.</s><s>This evidence is consistent with data of Lessio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, confirming the major role of the wild vegetation in the spread of FD.</s><s>Similarly, untreated vineyards are a known source of infected S. titanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>However, at some of the sites, the proportion of FDp-carrier insects was similar in the two compartments.</s><s>If we assume that the proportion of FDp-infected leafhoppers can be used as a marker of insect dispersal, we can speculate that at most of our sites (AT, CI, MO, PA, and PC), there was a flow of S. titanus between the cultivated and wild compartments of the vineyard agroecosystem.</s><s>On the contrary, at LM, the two populations were apparently separated.</s><s>In fact, very few insects were FDp carriers inside the vineyards, and many were infected in the wild compartment.</s><s>Interestingly, at LM, the wild vegetation was present in a large area standing downhill and below the level of the vineyard, with a woodland shield protecting the vineyard from major air flows.</s><s>It is then possible that leafhoppers, in the absence of ascendant air flows, are unable to fly upwards and reach the vineyard.</s><s>Indeed, without prevalent wind conditions, S. titanus does not move far <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Where the wild vegetation surrounding the vineyard is at the same height or above the vineyard, leafhoppers may move freely between the two compartments or into the vineyard itself.</s><s>Also, where the wild vegetation is below the level of the vineyard but upward and downward air currents are present, the leafhoppers might circulate between the two compartments.</s><s>The role of wind in S. titanus dispersal has been noticed and considered in pest risk assessment of FD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The proportion of FDp-infected vectors slightly increased over the summer, in line with the data of Lessio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; it is worth remembering that this proportion increased in spite of the higher mortality of FD-infected S. titanus, demonstrated by Bressan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Increase in the proportion of infected insect vectors over the season is expected, since FDp circulates, multiplies, and thus persists for life in the insect body.</s><s>With time, chances for the insects to move and feed on an infected source plants obviously increase, and this also contributes to increasing the proportion of FDp-positive insects during the summer season.</s><s>However, in July, the proportion of FDp-positive adults was already high, and this may have two concurrent explanations: (i) most of the insects acquired phytoplasmas at the nymphal stages and were already infected when the adult emerged, and (ii) a number of insects collected inside the vineyard in July already came from outside the vineyard, where chances of feeding on an infected wild Vitis were greater.</s><s>Actually, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that, overall, one fourth of the wild, asymptomatic Vitis tested at random were FDp-infected, while percentages of infected plants within the vineyards were generally lower.</s><s>Therefore, the increase in FDp-positive insects may be partly explained by the increasing load of FDp in the insects due to multiplication over time.</s><s>This multiplication of FDp in most insects that fed on infected source plants would overcome the detection threshold of the PCR assay.</s><s>The chosen real-time PCR assay detects phytoplasmas well before the completion of their latent period (about one month, during which the vector is infected but not infectious yet).</s><s>However, FDp could also be acquired by adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">31]</ref>, and this is also consistent with our observations.</s><s>In previous papers, we demonstrated that infected vines have low FDp load early in the season <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and that acquisition of FDp by S. titanus correlates with phytoplasma load in the plant <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>.</s><s>We can then speculate that, as the season progresses, the likelihood of FDp acquisition by the vectors increases and this may also account for the increasing proportion of infected insects recorded during our survey.</s><s>The proportion of FDp-carrier leafhoppers inside the vineyard showed a positive correlation with the proportion of infected vines at the same site, confirming that PCR detection of FDp in the vector is a good marker of disease spread/prevalence in the vineyard.</s><s>However, since the R 2 of the model was equal to 0.57, presumably other factors, besides the proportion of infected leafhoppers inside the vineyard, may account for the spread of the disease within a vineyard (e.g., the susceptibility of grapevine cultivars).</s><s>Actually, the vineyards were cultivated with different varieties, and these may show different levels of susceptibility to FD <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; differential susceptibility was not taken into account in this work because only empirical observations are available for local varieties cultivated in the Piedmont Region so far.</s><s>Analyses of a robust set of experimental data on the susceptibility of different vine varieties are ongoing in our laboratory.</s></p></div>
