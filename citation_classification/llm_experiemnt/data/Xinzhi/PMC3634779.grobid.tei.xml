<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insect Chambers</head><p><s>Insect chambers consisted of single species of insects (see section 2.1) caged individually and/or in groups within standard (100 mm615 mm) or smaller (35 mm610 mm) plastic Petri dishes.</s><s>A single ParafilmH or clear plastic 'kitchen' wrap (multiple brands tried, each being viable) layer was stretched across the top of the plate to seal it from insect escape and to provide a stylet penetrable surface for insect probing; hereafter called a 'mock feeding chamber' (MFC).</s><s>Parts of the formed stylet sheaths on the membrane interior (directly accessible to the insect) and exterior (insect stylet probe accessible) surfaces are hereafter designated 'flange' and 'sheath face', respectively.</s></p><p><s>MFCs were maintained within clear PyrexH baking dishes with the membrane (film) side up and the baking dish covered with a single layer of clear plastic wrap to prevent external contaminant interactions with the membrane surface during incubation.</s><s>MFCs were incubated at temperature (25uC), relative humidity (75%), and light:dark cycle of 14:10 hours during experiments that ranged from 0-10 minutes up to 72 hours in duration.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole Stylet Sheath Collection</head><p><s>To collect intact D. citri stylet sheaths (sheath with flange attached), we used Solvy TM Stabilizer (SulkyH, Kennesaw, GA), a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol membrane, that provided a stylet penetrable probing surface for sheath deposition.</s><s>After deposition, the membrane was removed from the MFC and washed with 100% ethanol (Aaper, Shelbyville, KY) to remove insect debris.</s><s>The membrane was then immersed in Nanopure H 2 O to dissolve and liberate the sheaths into solution.</s><s>This solution was sequentially filtered using a Nalgene reusable vacuum filtration system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a combination of Spectra/meshH polyester membranes (Spectrum Labs, Rancho Dominguez, CA) of 50 mm and 10 mm pore sizes.</s><s>The filter (50 mm) was used to separate large particulates from the sheath/ Solvy TM solution and the filtrate was then passed through a 10 mm filter capturing intact stylet sheaths.</s><s>The filter (10 mm) was then carefully removed from the vacuum filtering system and gently washed with a gentle stream of 100% ethanol to rinse the sheaths from the filter's surface.</s><s>The ethanol/stylet sheath rinse was carefully collected into a clean glass container and stored at 24uC for analyses.</s><s>Spectra/mesh membrane pore sizes were adjusted depending on the size of the expected sheaths for capture/harvest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)</head><p><s>SEM micrographs were obtained using two methods.</s><s>The first method employed a 'tape lift' procedure using 6 mm diameter SEM carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscope Sciences [EMS], Hatfield, PA) affixed to the center of SEM aluminum specimen mounts (EMS).</s><s>Utilizing the stub base as a handle, the exposed adhesive surface was gently affixed and subsequently detached (repeatedly) across the sheath face of a MFC directly attaching air formed sheaths to the carbon adhesive tab surface, resulting in partial sheath isolation (minus the flange).</s><s>These were then directly analyzed by SEM (pre-sputtering) using a Hitachi S-4800 Scanning Electron Microscope, (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 5 KV, 7 KV, 10 KV or 25 KV.</s><s>Subsequently the stubs were gold/palladium sputter coated using a Gold/Palladium Hummer TM 6.2 sputtering system (Anatech USA, Union City, CA) then reanalyzed by SEM.</s></p><p><s>The second method employed a novel technique for direct SEM imagery of both membrane surfaces (flange and sheath faces).</s><s>Briefly, CellstarH 35 mm610 mm tissue culture (Greiner Bio-One North America Inc., Monroe, NC) MFCs using clear plastic wrap membrane were made for each of the insects used in this study.</s><s>Chambers were incubated for 2 to 24 hours depending on the insect used and its propensity to probe the membrane.</s><s>Following this, the sidewalls of the MFCs were drilled with two opposing holes using a flame heated 20 gauge needle to puncture through the plastic sidewall allowing the MFCs interior to equilibrate in the vacuum of the gold/palladium sputter coating system.</s><s>Given the stringency involved with direct surface flange/sheath SEM analysis, plastic wrap provided a greater material stability/ endurance during the sputter plating and SEM processes as opposed to the more ductile ParafilmH.</s></p><p><s>To analyze the flange face (interior membrane surface), the membrane was carefully removed from the MFC of interest and replaced inverted (flange face up) and stretched across a like-sized Petri dish.</s><s>These new chambers were subsequently drilled, sputter coated, and the flange deposits of selected insects were observed by SEM.</s><s>With SEM micrograph imagery capture was performed using the FE-PC SEM bundled software included in the SEM microscope control system.</s></p><p><s>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) D. citri adults feeding on citrus leaves in propylene tubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> were immobilized (while feeding) by placing the rearing tube in a 220uC freezer for 10 minutes.</s><s>These adults were then gently pulled away from the leaf (with their stylets still extended) using fine forceps under a stereomicroscope.</s><s>D. citri heads with extended stylets were immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4uC for 3 to 4 days, post fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 to 2 hours at 4uC, washed in buffer, dehydrated in ethanol and acetonitrile (substitute for acetone), then embedded in EMBed-812 (both from EMS).</s><s>Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope (in transmission mode) at 25 KV.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confocal Microscopy</head><p><s>For confocal differential interference contrast (DIC) and confocal laser microscopy, a Zeiss LSM 510 AXIO Imager M1 confocal microscope was used (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) controlled by Zen software version 2009 SP2 (Zeiss).</s><s>To mount the in a ¯ere stylet sheaths on glass slides, 50 mL of mounting medium (70% glycerol in 30% PBS) was applied directly to the sheath surface of the MFC for direct harvest of partial sheaths from the membrane surface using a bent glass rod.</s><s>Then 10 mL of this medium (with harvested stylet sheaths) was directly pipetted onto pre-cleaned microscope slides.</s><s>Glass covers (No. 1 thickness, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) were applied and their edges sealed with clear nail polish (EMS).</s><s>Solvy TM isolated whole D. citri stylet sheaths, were imaged by confocal DIC post stylet sheath collection, mounted on pre-cleaned microscope slides, covered, and sealed with nail polish as described previously.</s><s>In some cases, D. citri nymphal exuviae were gently pulled away from the leaf (with their stylets still extended) under a stereomicroscope, preserved in 70% ethanol, then mounted and examined by confocal DIC as described.</s><s>Additionally, hand sections of Duncan grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfadyen) leaf midribs fed on by D. citri were stained with propidium iodide following standard protocols and mounted for confocal laser and confocal DIC microscopy as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The formation of in a ¯ere stylet sheaths by D. citri, A. nerii, A. gossypii, T. citricida, B. tabaci, H. vitripennis, F. virgata, and P. pyriformis illustrates formation of sheaths without host tissue (plant) or nonhost liquid or agar medium interactions or stimuli.</s><s>Additional findings from this study include: i) stylet sheath formation does not require a persistent resistance against the stylets (post penetration of the membrane) as a stimulation to elicit sheath secretions as previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; as the stylet bundle penetrates through the membrane material, air resistance is minimal, and sheath formation still occurs (Video's S1-S6); ii) stylet probing of the membrane was virtually instantaneous upon caging in the MFCs for each of these phytophagous hemipterans; iii) the insects did not require an additional stimuli to induce these probing events, suggesting a proclivity for exploratory probing of their environment; and iv) solidification of stylet sheaths appeared to occur rapidly in a ¯ere.</s><s>These findings expand our knowledge of stylet sheath formation for these tested hemipterans; however, they do not indicate whether molecular compositional differences exist between in a ¯ere versus in planta formed stylet sheaths.</s></p><p><s>Common similarities in physical/morphological form appear between both in a ¯ere (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, 2, 3, 5 and Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>) and in planta (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) D. citri stylet sheaths, including flange, sheath branching, bulbous formations, and neck regions.</s><s>These similarities between these D. citri in a ¯ere and in planta sheath forms may suggest a common chemical/structural composition as the mechanisms for sheath deposition may be similar; however, comparative chemical analyses of these should clarify this.</s><s>Interestingly, a comparison of the neck regions from Solvy TM isolated D. citri stylet sheaths (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>-D) appears to correlate with previous reported descriptions of in planta sheaths from other hemipterans: the psyllid Ctenarytaina spatulata (Brennan et al 2000 Figure 2B <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>) and the planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Wang et al 2008 Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>, B, and D <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>).</s><s>In these descriptions, the neck regions are indicated in planta as the stylet sheaths pass through the upper epidermal layer of the host plant tissue.</s></p><p><s>Common morphological features of in a ¯ere and in planta stylet sheaths support the use of 'mock feeding chambers' as a viable means for behavioral and stylet sheath compositional analyses for these hemipterans.</s><s>Here we demonstrate the flexibility of MFC systems by altering the probing membrane types for specific purposes.</s><s>For instance, the use of clear plastic wrap allowed for highly magnified real-time microscopic observations and live action video of hemipteran stylet sheath formation (e.g.</s><s>Video S3).</s><s>The use of Solvy TM water soluble membrane provided the means to isolate intact sheaths providing for in-depth compositional analyses (Morgan, J. K., et al, unpublished data) that lack potentially confounding background elements (traces of artificial diet or host plant tissue).</s><s>Therefore, varying the membrane type for different MFC configurations may be useful for alternate analytical purposes for hemipteran stylet sheath or related studies.</s></p><p><s>Our results also present a method from which environmental influences can affect behavioral activities.</s><s>For example, H. vitripennis, B. tabaci, and aphids each produce short sheaths in a ¯ere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref> and B, E and F, I and J); however, previous literature indicates that stylet sheaths for H. vitripennis, B. tabaci, and aphids have long and/or multi-branched sheaths in planta <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, manipulations of chemical applications to either the flange or sheath faces of an MFC membrane could provide a method to monitored for influences on the feeding behavior in relation to sheath structure and length.</s><s>This common attribute of short sheaths produced on MFCs by H. vitripennis, B. tabaci, and aphids is most likely a manifestation of these insects ability to 'sense' the environment on which it is feeding and 'deciding' that the environment represents an 'unsuitable' feeding site; hence, these spend less energy by reducing their probing efforts.</s><s>Clearly, the insects have different responses in this process since the MFC naı ¨ve H. vitripennis probe initially often in rapid succession ,2 to 7 times upon caging (typically within the first ten minutes) and then stop while naı ¨ve D. citri probe continually throughout a 24-hours (and beyond) averaging approximately 16 (62.1</s><s>St. Error) probes per 24-hour period.</s><s>The membrane feeding system we present in this paper should be readily adaptable for further studies on this behavior.</s></p><p><s>Alternate differences are evident when comparing the flange regions of stylet sheaths of D. citri and aphids versus H. vitripennis and B. tabaci (we did not examine the flanges for F. virgata and P. pyriformis).</s><s>For D. citri (Figure <ref type="figure">2H</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref>) and aphids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4K</ref>  ), which is consistent with our in a ¯ere flange findings for these insects.</s><s>These data support a hypothesis that D. citri and aphids secrete sheath material during retraction of the stylet bundle resulting in flange closure.</s></p><p><s>For D. citri, supplemental evidence supporting sheath material secretion upon stylet bundle retraction is indicated by the variable diameters within individual canals for D. citri stylet canal tracks that appear to range from ,2.5 ,3.5 mm (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>, and Figure <ref type="figure">S1G-I</ref>).</s><s>Evidence that stylet canals can be completely filled for D. citri (Figure <ref type="figure">S1G</ref>-I, inset images) also strongly indicate this.</s><s>As the average adult D. citri stylet bundle diameter is ,5 mm (Figure <ref type="figure">2F</ref>, note flange circumambient the stylet bundle indicating that the complete stylet bundle enters the canal of the stylet sheath), a D. citri stylet sheath canal having a diameter less than 5 mm may suggest that stylet bundle retraction secretion is involved or that drying effects of the stylet sheath have constricted the canal diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The mechanism for the solidification of stylet sheath has been thought to require interaction with host plant tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or artificial media, yet these in a ¯ere stylet sheaths refute this for these tested Hemipterans (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, 2, 3, 4, 5, and Video's S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6).</s><s>As referenced previously, prior work has implied in a ¯ere solidified sheath material occurring in sharpshooters <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In this prior study, the authors indicate specific protein differences between the profiles of brush induced sheath materials and sheath materials harvested by differing methods (parafilm collected over diet, direct gland removal saliva harvest, and filter paper extracts 'milking').</s><s>Their data indicated the necessity of protein factors for full stylet sheath formation to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Other hypotheses suggest that oxygen specific interactions are needed for proper sheath gelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and support for this has recently been indicated for aphid stylet sheaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Experiments using the in a ¯ere system shown here can be envisioned where the gas composition of the feeding chamber can be manipulated to block oxygen from below the membrane surface.</s><s>This would provide a convenient alternate method of testing oxygen requirements.</s></p><p><s>This study demonstrates that the ability to form stylet sheaths in a ¯ere is a common trait for multiple taxonomically diverse hemipterans (D. citri, A. nerii, A. gossypii, T. citricida, B. tabaci, H. vitripennis, F. virgata, and P. pyriformis).</s><s>Each probed the membrane of their MFCs regardless of membrane type within the first few minutes of caging.</s><s>Differences in stylet sheath lengths by species on MFCs solicit further inquiry into
