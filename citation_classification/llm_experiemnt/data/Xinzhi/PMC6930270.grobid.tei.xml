<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Citrus is directly linked with the "Sunshine State" agricultural identity.</s><s>Unfortunately, Florida's total citrus production declined 83% from 291.8 million boxes in 2003/04 to 49.58 million boxes in 2017/18, indicating a severe crisis in the fruit market (U.S Department of Agriculture, 2019).</s><s>Citrus bearing acreage also declined drastically from 679,000 acres in 2003/ 04 to 400,900 acres in 2017/18.</s><s>On-tree citrus values dropped 47% from $1.046B in 2008/09 to $0.551B in 2017/18 (U.S Department of Agriculture, 2019).</s><s>Florida grapefruit production for the fresh market experienced an even steeper decline, dropping by 90% from 1.738 million tons in 2003/04 to 0.165 million tons in 2017/18.</s><s>Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) bearing acreage also reduced from 82,300 acres in 2003/04 to 29,800 acres in 2017/18 (U.S Department of <ref type="bibr">Agriculture, 2019)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This devastating decline was first caused by State efforts to eradicate citrus canker (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.</s><s>citri), followed by catastrophic hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ferrarezi et al., 2019)</ref>, and then by the devastating citrus greening disease or huanglongbing (HLB), associated with the phloem-plugging bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas).</s><s>Eradication efforts for citrus canker were halted in 2006, while HLB has spread throughout Florida, with more than 80% of the citrus trees currently infected by the disease.</s></p><p><s>HLB is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri) <ref type="bibr">(Bové, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The vector is a small 3 to 4 mm long insect.</s><s>Shoots with newly developing tender leaves are needed by the females for oviposition and nymphal development; whereas adults can survive but not reproduce over winter, on mature leaves <ref type="bibr">(Qureshi and Stansly, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The adults require feeding on young shoots to develop and reproduce.</s><s>Insect development is temperature-dependent.</s><s>Under optimal conditions psyllids can go through 10-12 generations each year in Florida <ref type="bibr">(Qureshi and Stansly, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Qureshi and Stansly, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Nymphs go through five nymphal instars to develop to adulthood in approximately 2 weeks.</s><s>Diaphorina citri has a high reproductive rate and a single female is capable of laying several hundred eggs.</s><s>The intrinsic rate of population increase in the absence of any biotic mortality factors was estimated in the range of 125-285 <ref type="bibr">(Qureshi and Stansly, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Nymphs and adults cause direct damage to the plants by feeding on the young shoots and leaves.</s><s>Both biological and chemical methods of control provide significant reduction in the psyllid populations <ref type="bibr">(Qureshi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Qureshi and Stansly, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Qureshi and Stansly, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Qureshi et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The planting of HLB-free trees from commercial nurseries, early removal of infected trees, application of foliar bactericides, and vector control are the most used strategies to manage the disease in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Dala-Paula et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Scouting and frequent spraying of insecticides constitute the core of mitigation programs to reduce ACP population, reducing the feeding activity and the disease transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Stansly et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In Brazil, frequent and coordinated insecticide application in area-wide programs is a successful strategy to manage the ACP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bassanezi et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Geographical isolation and mountainous landscape also naturally reduce the ACP population.</s><s>In the United States, specifically in Florida, those strategies were tested through the Citrus Health Management Areas (CHMAs) and were not successful due to the environmental conditions and extremely high psyllid population <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Singerman et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the use of aggressive vector management programs, it has been virtually impossible to reduce the spread of the HLB in Florida.</s><s>Completely enclosed screenhouses can physically exclude the vector and prevent disease transmission <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>The screen acts as a physical barrier, blocking psyllids and insects larger than 50 mesh (0.297 mm) from damaging citrus trees <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>The system provides a shaded environment with reduced solar radiation and evapotranspiration, creating an ideal environment for vigorous plant growth, increased fruit yield and improved fruit quality <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017a</ref>).</s><s>An HLB-free environment allows the production of high-quality fresh fruit, which retails for a high cash price due to the current high demand and shortage in supply.</s></p><p><s>The system originated at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) Indian River Research and Education Center in Fort Pierce, FL and has successfully been tested at the UF/IFAS Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, FL as well <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>The economics of citrus under protective screens (CUPS) is being determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Schumann and Singerman, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>To date, there are approximately 161 ha of commercial CUPS in Florida, and 60 ha are planned <ref type="bibr">(Eduardo Pines and Steven Callaham, personal communication)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The disadvantages of growing citrus indoors are related to the increase the populations of certain pests such as citrus rust mites (Phyllocoptruta oleivora), snow scales (Unaspis citri), and thrips (Frankliniella spp.), and diseases like citrus greasy spot (Mycosphaerella citri).</s><s>Screenhouse construction costs are still high at approximately $10.76 per square meter, which does not include irrigation and trees.</s><s>The 40-to 50-mesh high-density polyethylene screen may need replacement every 5 years (up to $5.38 per square meter) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Schumann et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies reported on the effect of screenhouses on internal environmental parameters and tree physiology <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ferrarezi et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>Solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration were 22% and 23.8% lower inside the screenhouses compared to the open-air.</s><s>Air temperature was greater inside the screenhouses whereas wind gusts were higher in the open-air.</s><s>There was no difference in cumulative rainfall between both production systems <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>Trees grown inside the enclosed screenhouses had greater canopy area compared to the open-air plots <ref type="bibr">(Ferrarezi et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>The larger canopy growth inside the screenhouses related to higher fruit yield and fruit quality.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Schumann et al. (2018)</ref> reported yields greater than 76,218 kg/ha and with good internal quality and all met grade requirements for the fresh market (100% pack-out).</s></p><p><s>Our objectives were to assess the ability of enclosed screenhouses to exclude the ACP, stop HLB inoculation and dissemination, and improve fruit yield of in-ground and container-grown 6-year-old "Ray Ruby" grapefruit at super-high planting densities relative to open-air trees.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The screenhouses are able to keep psyllids out when the screen is intact.</s><s>No psyllids were detected prior to 2017 according to <ref type="bibr">Ferrarezi et al. (2017a)</ref>.</s><s>However, the subsequent passage of hurricanes or tropical storms tore the screens, allowing psyllids to enter into the screenhouses.</s><s>The first single psyllid inside the UF/IFAS Indian River Research and Education Center (IRREC) CUPS was detected in May 2017, 7 months after Hurricane Matthew caused minor damages to the screen in October 2016 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, top).</s><s>In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused severe damages to all four screenhouses, by loosening guy wires, bending peripheral poles, lifting off weed ground cloth, overturning all open-air pots, lifting out center poles 30 to 60 cm of ground, causing rips in screens, and provoking the detachment of S hooks.</s><s>Repairs were completed in April 2018, but large openings in the screenhouse allowed psyllids to enter the enclosures.</s><s>Psyllid population increased quickly and were difficult to control due to a faulty sprayer, reaching on average 15.13 psyllids in treatments in-ground and 81.25 psyllids in pots when averaging the two rootstocks.</s><s>During this time, there were no significant differences among any of the treatments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, top, P = 0.3624).</s><s>In 2019 ≈1 psyllid was detected in in-ground trees and 1 psyllid in pots due to another tropical storm in April 2019 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, top).</s><s>Despite the presence of psyllids in the screenhouses in 2018 (2017 and 2019 numbers are insignificant), HLB was never detected in any of the trees.</s><s>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, bottom, P = 0.0014) It is possible the psyllids that multiplied inside the screenhouses were not infected by the CLas and the lack of constant re-inoculation was sufficient to prevent infection to occur (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, bottom, P = 0.0014).</s></p><p><s>Trunk diameter increased overtime in all treatments as trees continued to grow, with in-ground trees showing the highest values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, top, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>There were no significant differences between the screenhouse and open-air treatments.</s><s>Canopy volume increased only in the in-ground treatments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, bottom, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>In 2018/19 the low canopy volume value is the result of tree hedging and topping.</s><s>Potted trees resulted in the lowest volume possibly due to the growing media used: a medium consisting mainly by washed silica sand, since all the organic matter initially added was decomposed after 2 years.</s></p><p><s>Trees cultivated under screenhouses produced the greatest fruit yield.</s><s>The treatment planted in-ground and on "US-897" yielded 51,081 kg/ha-twice the potted treatment on "Sour Orange" and thrice on "US-897" (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>This value is four times the 2017/18 U.S. average of 13,842 kg/ha (U.S.</s><s>Department of Agriculture, 2019).</s><s>Even though the fruit yield was higher than the national average, trees cultivated in pots did not perform as expected in this study.</s><s>One of the justifications was the use of sand as a substrate.</s><s>Over time, the organic matter decomposed, and the resulting media was 100% coarse sand.</s><s>This reduced the water holding capacity and the water availability, most likely resulting in drought stresses that led to lower fruit yields.</s><s>The accumulated fruit yield after 4 years was 130,306 kg/ha for trees grown under the screenhouse planted inground and on "US-897" followed by trees under the enclosures in pots on "Sour Orange" rootstock (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Fruit diameter and number of fruit on covered trees was statistically higher than the open-air treatments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>The data represents the average of eight trees and four replications, and several trees in the open-air had zero fruit due to the negative effect of HLB disease.</s><s>The number of fruit increased drastically in 2018/19 in comparison to previous years (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, bottom, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>That is expected since trees reached bearing age.</s><s>However, there as a significant amount of small-sized fruit (&lt;100 mm).</s><s>Fruit diameter continued to decline with progressing years in open-air treatments, likely because of the high HLB incidence.</s></p><p><s>The soluble solids content was high in potted trees with 11.8% in "Sour Orange" rootstock and 10.5% in "US-897" probably due to the constant stress induced by the growing media and limited container volume (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, top, P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>In-ground trees in open-air resulted in the lowest soluble solids content and titratable acidity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, bottom, P &lt; 0.0117).</s></p><p><s>In Florida, the grapefruit harvested for the fresh fruit market needs a ratio of at least 8:1 or 8.</s><s>This value changes with titrabable acidity and time of the year, and is just an industry reference.</s><s>The average ratio in the 2018/19 season was approximately 7.7 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, top, P &lt; 0.03).</s><s>Ratio declined over time, but acids tended to increase.</s><s>Yield of solids represents the amount of juice per box of citrus by the soluble solids content, indicating the economic return to growers.</s><s>If all yield for fresh fruit production is converted into yield of solids per hectare (not a common practice in the fresh fruit market; used for reference here), the highest amount was obtained in covered trees planted in-ground on "US-897" (1,826 kg solids/ha) and in pots on "Sour Orange" (1,419 kg solids/ha) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, bottom, P &lt;

0.05).</s><s>However, this result did not extend to the micronutrient     concentrations as there was no major container vs. in-ground effect.</s><s>Overall, there was not effect of screenhouse vs. open-air treatments on either macronutrient or micronutrient concentrations.</s><s>For the most part, micronutrient concentrations were seldom affected by any treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, P &lt; 0.05).</s></p><p><s>Ongoing studies in FL had shown horticultural feasibility in producing trees indoors due to high fruit yields and pack-outs.</s><s>The economics of citrus undercover production systems is still being determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Schumann and Singerman, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The higher cost of CUPS must be offset by the highest possible yield of premium quality fresh fruit with a high market price in order to be profitable.</s><s>Fortunately, the price of fresh fruit, especially for tangerine varieties, has been on an upward trend in recent years, totally justifying the investment cost.</s><s>Because CUPS is a relatively new citrus production system with new challenges, current guidelines are preliminary and undergoing constant refinement through research.</s><s>Mites and thrips may selectively enter through the permeable screen, while some of the larger beneficial pest predators are excluded.</s><s>Greasy spot and other fungal diseases also thrive in the more humid conditions of the screenhouse environment.</s><s>These non-lethal but economically important pests and diseases must be adequately controlled with integrated pest management approaches customized for CUPS in order to avoid loss of fruit yield and fruit quality.</s></p><p><s>However, these potential positive indicators are irrelevant if the screenhouse structure cannot resist high wind gusts and precipitation, and if the materials and design used to build largescale facilities are not engineered to last and endure the weather.</s><s>Most of the existing experimental and commercial facilities have been designed with limited engineering criteria, and the future of commercial CUPS in Florida lies on finding the adequate structure to resist extreme weather events since that is the highest percentage of the system initial investment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>The screenhouses drastically reduced the number of psyllids in the citrus trees and avoided HLB disease, resulting in increased fruit yield and fruit quality.</s><s>However, the screen effectiveness in blocking psyllids is susceptible to extreme weather events in Florida.</s><s>The cost of the technology is still under evaluation along with structural modifications needed to deal with environmental challenges such as tropical storms and hurricanes.</s><s>IRREC CUPS screenhouses are 6-years old, and the screen is experiencing degradation from ultraviolet light, rainfall, and wind, resulting in screen rupture at several points in the roof, requiring replacement since the material lifespan is over.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Air temperature, rainfall and reference evapotranspiration inside the screenhouse and in the open-air plots.</s><s>Average of 365 days per year.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,92.07,594.31,411.08,91.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
