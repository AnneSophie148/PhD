<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a primary staple cereal <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tuyen et al., 2012)</ref> and is also a host species to many pests, which can significantly reduce rice yield.</s><s>Among those insect pests, brown planthopper (BPH), white-backed planthopper (WBPH), and small brown planthopper (SBPH) are typical delphacidae planthoppers and major piercing-sucking pests of rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yang and Zhang, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Like BPH and WBPH, the SBPH is a typical phloem-sucking insect and a widely spread pest during the main rice-growing areas in East Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akira et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>SBPH causes significant yield losses by directly sucking the sap from rice phloem.</s><s>The infected rice plants turn yellow and wilt and eventually die <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tuyen et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">In 2004 and</ref><ref type="bibr">2005, 3</ref>.4 million hectares of rice were infected in Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces of China <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zhang et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>One generation of SBPH needs about 35-40 days and about 5-6 generations occur in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces each year.</s><s>SBPH also serves as a vector of many pathogens such as rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wang et al., 2010)</ref> and rice stripe virus (RSV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Use insecticide to control SBPHs is expensive, detrimental to natural predators and conducive to resistance built up in pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tanaka et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to the chemical control, host-plant resistance is the most economical and effective approach to control SBPHs.</s><s>Understanding on how rice responds to SBPH infestation will contribute to developing strategies for SBPH control.</s><s>However, the lack of resistant sources to SBPH has potentially impeded efforts to understand how rice responds to SBPH infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yang and Zhang, 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interactions between rice and planthoppers are complex.</s><s>Gene expression profile studies have shown that genes involved in cell growth and photosynthesis are down-regulated, and genes involved in plant defenses and macromolecule degradation are up-regulated after BPH infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2008)</ref>, suggesting the alteration of C and N metabolism and a shift from growth and development to defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The key BPH defense include Ca 2+ signaling, PR genes, MAPK cascades and receptor kinase, transcriptional regulation and protein post-translational modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wang Y. et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lv et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In general, rice plants defend against BPH through activation of the pathway of the SAdependent systemic acquired resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yang and Zhang, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Proteins involved in SA biosynthesis are induced by BPH infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wei et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In response to WBPH attack, the defense proteins of thaumatin-, pathogenesis-, germin-related protein and α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor are up-regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Defense genes involved in secondary metabolism (i.e., multicopper oxidase protein, terpene synthase, agmatine coumaroyltransferase and anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase) are up-regulated in WBPH-resistant cultivar <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In the interaction process between SBPH and rice, genes for TIFY protein, trypsin inhibitor genes and transcription factor genes are associated with SBPH resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zheng et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Fe homeostasis-related genes encoding enzymes that are involved in phytosiderophore biosynthesis, Fe transporters and regulators also display altered expression in rice after attack by SBPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The protein related to kinases, β-glucanases and oxidative stress response are differentially induced after BPH infestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wei et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Comparing IR64 with its mutants, 22 proteins are associated with resistance to BPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sangha et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The protein expression profile analysis in phloem sap between BPH-susceptible and BPH-resistant rice lines after BPH infestation has shown changes in the levels of proteins involved in redox regulation, signal transduction, protein and carbohydrate metabolic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Du et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Proteomics is a useful tool to reveal physiological changes at the cellular level, but this technique has not been applied to the study of rice plant response to SBPH.</s><s>In our previous studies, a wild species, Oryza officinalis (acc.</s><s>HY018, 2n = 24, CC), was found to have high resistance to SBPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Yan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Three QTLs of resistance to SBPH have been identified in Pf9279-4, an introgression line derived from O. officinalis and O. sativa (cv.</s><s>02428) by using asymmetric somatic hybridization, and are located on chromosome 3, 7, and 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we analyzed the protein expression profile in rice leaf sheaths in response to SBPH

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of Antixenosis in Resistant Rice Plant Pf9279-4 to SBPH</head><p><s>This study showed that the fecundity of female adult SBPH settled on the Pf9279-4 was much lower than on the 02428, which resulted in low numbers of SBPH at the whole growth period of Pf9279-4.</s><s>The nymphal durations of SBPH on Pf9279-4 were longer than on 02428, resulting in less generations of SBPH.</s><s>The life spans of adult males and females were shorter on Pf9279-4 than on 02428, which led to the less damage of Pf9279-4 rice plants.</s><s>These data clearly validated the usefulness of Pf9279-4 in SBPH control.</s><s>The resistant type of Pf9279-4 to SBPH was antixenosis, which reduced the SBPH settling on the rice plants and significantly suppressed the feeding.</s></p></div>

mode of feeding lead to different molecular responses of plants to herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Du et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Little tissue damage can be produced by sucking insects.</s><s>It has now been recognized that plant immunity to piercingsucking insects resembles that in resistance to pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, as insects are more sophisticated than pathogens, the interaction between plant and insect is more intricate at protein level.</s><s>The DEPs identified in this study can be classified into regulatory and functional proteins.</s></p><p><s>Rice plants might perceive SBPH infestation stress signals by some receptors and sensors and transmit them to the cellular machinery by signal transduction to regulate gene expression.</s><s>Some regulatory DEPs that were higher in the SBPH-resistant rice plant after SBPH infestation than the susceptible one are potentially involved in signal transduction, i.e., mannose-binding FIGURE 7 | qPCR analysis of gene expression in leaf sheath at three time points (0, 6, and 12 h after SBPH infestation).</s><s>Relative mRNA

of DEPs involved in these processes were up-regulated in Pf9279-4, such as P0 60S, 50S ribosomal protein L12, elongation factor Tu, PDI and ETIF5A.</s><s>These proteins are involved in protein synthesis.</s></p><p><s>Higher levels of these proteins in the SBPH-resistant line indicate that plant cells of Pf9279-4 may be more active in protein synthesis than those of

glycolysis and energy metabolism.</s></p><p><s>ROS produced during stress conditions might act as a signaling molecule for stress responses.</s><s>It can also cause damage to cellular components.</s><s>Plants can maintain the ROS level through sophisticated mechanisms such as scavenging them by antioxidant defense proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mahmood et al.,

protein, IRLs.</s><s>GSH-Px can protect the membrane system in plants under stress.</s><s>Under the action of GSTs, GSH combines with toxic substances to protect tissues.</s><s>Isoflavone reductase is the key enzyme to synthesize isoflavone, which plays an important role in removing ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kim et al., 2010)</ref> and styrene acrylic pigment
