<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Small non-coding RNAs play key roles in the regulation of gene expression and control of transposon activity in eukaryotes.</s><s>These RNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate gene expression, endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo siRNAs) that regulate gene expression and transposition in somatic cells, and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that silence transposons in germ cells.</s><s>They are key components of the various small RNA silencing pathways and act within protein complexes including the Argonaute proteins, which represent a large protein family with different small RNA specificities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>All members of the Argonaute family share three structural motifs: the Piwi-Argonaute-Zwille (PAZ) domain, the Middle (MID) domain, and the PIWI domain.</s><s>The function of the PAZ domain is not known but it can bind to the characteristic 2-base 39 overhangs of small RNAs (sRNAs) digested by RNase III.</s><s>The MID and PIWI domains, on the other hand, are associated with the 59 ends of the small RNAs.</s><s>Among these three domains, PIWI contains the catalytic DDH triad composed of two Aspartic Acid residues (D) and one Histidine (H) residue and responsible for the RNAseH-like endonuclease activity.</s><s>It can trigger the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) guided hydrolysis of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and it possesses the endonuclease ''slicer'' activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Argonaute genes are highly conserved but their numbers vary between organisms ranging from one copy in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, to five in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and 27 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The Argonaute protein family is subdivided into two subgroups, the Ago subfamily and the Piwi subfamily, according to their distinct functions and small RNA specificities.</s><s>The Ago subfamily binds to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as well as miRNAs, playing a central role in siRNA and miRNA silencing pathway; the Piwi subfamily is involved in the piRNA pathway, participating in germline development, meiosis and gametogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> but their role in somatic tissues remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, the Ago subfamily is composed of the miRNA-related Argonaute-1 (Ago1) and the siRNA-related Argonaute-2 (Ago2) whilst the Piwi subfamily, which includes Aubergine (Aub), Piwi and Argonaute-3 (Ago3), is involved in the piRNA pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Usually expression of the Piwi subfamily is restricted to the germ cells while that of the Ago subfamily is ubiquitous.</s><s>However, this scenario has been questioned since Drosophila Piwi has been recently identified in both the germline and the ovarian somatic support cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in contrast to Ago3 and Aub that are restricted to the germline <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, piRNAs in Drosophila can be categorized as two distinct types: the germline piRNAs and the somatic piRNAs.</s><s>The germline piRNAs, which are associated with Aub, Piwi and Ago3, are processed by the ''ping-pong mechanism''.</s><s>The somatic piRNAs, which are usually associated only with Piwi, are generated via the ''primary piRNA model'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that the germline piRNAs are involved in germline specification, maintenance of germ cells, meiosis and transposon movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, roles for piRNAs in early embryogenesis have been described for the Piwi subfamily and piRNAs in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, maternally inherited piRNAs are present in early embryos where they provide resistance to transposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Aub and Ago3, both of which are components of the piRNA pathway, are found to associate with Smaug and the CCR4 deadenylase complex to regulate the decay of the maternal nanos mRNA, a posterior determinant in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In zebrafish, both ziwi and zili encode Piwi proteins that can bind piRNAs of opposite polarity and suppress the transposon activity in germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to these conserved roles in transposon defense and germline development, recent reports show that zili is involve in axis patterning via transforming growth factor (TGF)-b and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we provide information on the piRNA pathway for the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, an emerging genomic model organism with a recently sequenced and annotated genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>This phloem-sucking insect has an unusual capacity for phenotypic plasticity, displaying an ability to adapt its phenotype according to environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Aphids switch their reproductive mode in response to seasonal changes.</s><s>During spring and summer, aphids reproduce by clonal viviparous parthenogenesis: a single female can give birth to approximately 80 larvae in 10 days, all of which are genetically identical to each other and to their mother.</s><s>This reproductive mode allows a rapid and effective colonisation of host plants during the growing seasons.</s><s>In autumn, the decrease of day length induces parthenogenetic viviparous females (named sexuparae) that produce sexual males and sexual oviparous females (named oviparae).</s><s>Embryos in both virginoparae and sexuparae viviparous females complete development within the mother, and prior to larviposition germ cells within the embryos are specified and migrate to coalesce with the somatic gonads <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> -resulting in a phenomenon known as ''telescoping of generations''.</s><s>The sexual males and oviparous sexual females then mate and produce overwintering eggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The pea aphid thus offers a great opportunity to analyse the molecular mechanisms of sexual and asexual reproduction, including the roles of small non-coding RNAs in the alternation of reproductive modes and in the development of the different sexual and asexual morphs.</s><s>We describe here an expansion of the piRNA associated Argonaute family in the pea aphid.</s><s>This expansion correlates to a diversification of developmental and spatial expression profiles in different reproductive morphs.</s><s>Diversified expressions of these expanded copies suggest an adaptation of the piRNA pathways to contribute to the regulation of reproductive plasticity in aphids.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Piwi-type Argonautes in the pea aphid genome</head><p><s>Aphid homologues of genes from the Piwi subgroup of the Argonaute family (Piwi and Ago3) were identified in the A. pisum genome.</s><s>All of the eight Api-Piwi and the two Api-Ago3 deduced proteins possess the functional PAZ, MID and PIWI domains (Data S1) characteristic of the Argonaute family.</s><s>The main residues involved in the binding of the 59 end of small RNAs and the DDH catalytic triad are conserved in most of the A. pisum proteins, suggesting that these proteins are functional Argonautes.</s><s>However, the mutation of the DDH triad into DDR in Api-Piwi8 indicates that this protein may have lost slicer activity (Data S1).</s></p><p><s>In addition, we identified piwi homologues in the genome of another hemipteran, the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus.</s><s>The genome of R. prolixus has been recently sequenced (<ref type="url" target="http://genome">http://genome</ref>.</s><s>wustl.edu/genomes/view/rhodnius_prolixus/)</s><s>and it is to date the only sequenced genome in the same order (Hemiptera) as the pea aphid.</s><s>Different phylogenetic methods were tested (neighborjoining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) with different substitution models) and gave the same results (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> represents the ML tree with the BLOSUM62 model).</s><s>First, a group of Ago3like sequences was clearly identified, as it consists of a robust group with 100% bootstrap support.</s><s>Two complete copies (Api-ago3a and Api-ago3b) were identified in the pea aphid genome.</s><s>Interestingly, all other insect genomes surveyed contain a single ago3 gene.</s><s>In fact, the pea aphid was even found to contain a third copy Api-ago3c very close to Api-ago3b, but this third copy appears to be incomplete and contains in-frame stop codons, suggesting that it is a pseudogene (this sequence was thus discarded and not included in the analysis).</s><s>When compared to Api-ago3a, Api-ago3b appears to evolve more rapidly as shown by its longer branch.</s><s>For piwi-like genes, the A. pisum genome was found to contain eight complete copies (Api-piwi1 to 8) -three further piwi-like genes were detected; however, like Api-ago3c these were incomplete, having in-frame stop codons and frameshifts, and were thus considered as likely pseudogenes.</s><s>Piwi-like genes from A. pisum made a robust phylogenetic group, showing that the different copies arose though lineage-specific duplication.</s><s>This gene family is divided in two subgroups (Api-piwi2, 3, 5, 6 versus Api-piwi1, 4, 7, 8), which appear to correspond to a relatively ancient duplication event (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>More recent duplications would have followed, defining more recent groups of paralogues (Api-piwi2 and 5, Api-piwi3 and 6, and Api-piwi 1,4,7).</s><s>These closely related paralogues are particularly interesting to compare in terms of their expression profile, to determine the pace of specialisation or sub-functionalisation processes.</s></p><p><s>Gene amplifications can also be seen in representatives of the insect orders Hymenoptera (for Nasonia vitripennis and Harpegnathos saltator) and Diptera (for D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti); nevertheless, A. pisum shows the largest piwi expansion for any insect investigated to date.</s><s>Within the Culicidae (mosquitoes), the copies can be divided in two subgroups that probably correspond to a relatively ancient duplication preceding speciation.</s><s>In R. prolixus, the other hemipteran insect included in this analysis, genomic amplification was also detected, resulting in 3 copies (Rpr-piwi1 to 3).</s><s>However this amplification was found to be independent of the A. pisum duplications.</s><s>Interestingly, Rpr-piwi1 and Rpr-piwi2 are intronless and might have arisen through one retroposition event (followed by duplication), and the longer branches (in particular for Rpr-piwi2) suggest accelerated evolutionary rates for these two copies.</s><s>By contrast, none of the A. pisum copies are intronless.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression profiles in the reproductive morphs</head><p><s>Aphids display the amazing ability to switch from asexual parthenogenesis to sexual reproduction in response to seasonal modification of photoperiods.</s><s>Expression level of the eight Api-piwi and two Api-ago3 genes was analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in the different reproductive morphs of the pea aphid (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>): adult parthenogenetic virginoparae females (that produce parthenogenetic embryos), adult parthenogenetic sexuparae females (that produce sexual embryos), sexual oviparae females, and males.</s><s>For each morph, RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from three independent batches of 10 adult whole bodies collected 48 h after adult moult.</s><s>The ratio between the expression of the amplified gene and that of the Api-rpl7 reference gene was calculated to normalise the variation in experimental conditions.</s><s>An average expression level was calculated for each reproductive morph based on the expression level obtained from the three independent batches (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>ANOVA tests were performed on the normalised values for each reproductive morph.</s></p><p><s>All the eight Api-piwi and the two Api-ago3 genes were expressed in females but showed distinct expression profiles that varied between the morphs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Most Api-piwi genes and Api-ago3a genes were expressed at a lower level in males than in the three female morphs.</s><s>For example, Api-piwi2, 3, 4 and 6 were almost undetectable in males.</s><s>However, Api-piwi5 was strongly expressed in males, and Api-piwi7 expression level is stronger in males than in virginoparae and oviparae females.</s><s>As for genes that were preferentially expressed in some morphs, the following specific expression patterns were noteworthy: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The expression profiles of Api-piwi2 and Api-piwi8 discriminated between parthenogenetic females (virginoparae and sexuparae) and sexual females (oviparae), with Api-piwi2 clearly overexpressed in sexual females and Api-piwi8 in asexuals; (2) Api-piwi5 was preferentially expressed in males while it was only weakly expressed in the female morphs; (3) Api-piwi6 and Api-ago3b were preferentially overexpressed in sexuparae females.</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that the expansion of the piRNA-related piwi and ago3 genes in the pea aphid appears to be linked to its reproductive plasticity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developmental expression of Api-piwi and Api-ago3 genes</head><p><s>The temporal and spatial distribution of the eight Api-piwi and two Api-ago3 transcripts were analysed by in situ hybridisation on dissected ovarioles containing adult germaria, oocytes, and developing embryos.</s><s>For each gene, specific antisense riboprobe was designed to detect the distribution of the corresponding transcripts; sense riboprobes were applied in negative controls.</s><s>Because of the high sequence identity between Api-piwi1, 4 and 7 (.92%), we were not able to synthesise specific probes that could discriminate individual expressions of these three genes.</s><s>Nevertheless, in situ signals detected by antisense riboprobes synthesised from different template regions of Api-piwi1, 4, and 7 reflected consensus expression patterns.</s></p><p><s>In virginoparae, combinational expression of Api-piwi1, 4 and 7 was detected in germaria, oocytes, and early embryos before gastrulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 A-C</ref>).</s><s>Preferential expression was identified in the follicle cells located between germaria and oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, B) but newly-segregated germ cells were almost devoid of staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>During mid-embryogenesis, expression patterns appeared dynamic (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>, <ref type="figure">E</ref>), but in situ signals were preferentially detected in germ cells

almost undetected during oogenesis and embryogenesis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> G-I) except in early embryos before gastrulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I</ref>).</s><s>During mid and late embryogenesis, Api-piwi8 was weakly expressed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 J-L</ref>).</s><s>Gene expression was not detected in ovarioles hybridised with sense riboprobes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3M</ref>, <ref type="figure">N</ref>), indicating that the in situ signals identified with antisense probes accurately represented the distributions of Api-piwi1, 4 and/or 7 and Api-piwi8.</s><s>The developmental characteristics of embryos hybridised with probes of Api-piwi1, 4, 7, 8 and those stained with other gene probes are highlighted in the cartoon illustration shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3O</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Coding regions with more than 25% sequence difference were used as templates to synthesise probes to distinguish expression of the closely related Api-piwi2/Api-piwi5 and Api-piwi3/Api-piwi6 genes in virginoparae embryos.</s><s>During early development, transcripts of Api-piwi2 were restricted to the germarial lumen and the anterior region of the oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Weak expression of Api-piwi2 was visible in the newly-segregated germ cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>), but strong intensity of the germline-specific signals of Api-piwi2 were identified from gastrulation onward (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 C-E</ref>).</s><s>In comparison with Api-piwi2, a lower level of Api-piwi5 transcript abundance was identified in germaria and oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</s><s>Expression of Api-piwi5 was evenly distributed in embryos throughout development and no preferential expression was identified in germ cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 G-J</ref>).</s><s>Expression of Api-piwi3 was undetected in germaria and gastrulating embryos (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5 A-C</ref>), and transcripts of Api-piwi3 appeared not specifically restricted to germ cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>, <ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the transcripts of its closely
