<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Author Summary</head><p><s>Bacterial lineages have repeatedly evolved intimate symbioses with eukaryotic hosts, the most famous cases being those of the cell organelles, mitochondria, and plastids.</s><s>Symbiont genomes typically lose many ancestral genes, raising the question of how they function with so few genes.</s><s>In organelles, part of the answer involves gene transfer to the host genome, allowing maintenance of essential functions.</s><s>So far, the extent of gene transfer to hosts has not been assessed for other cases of intimate, obligate symbiosis.</s><s>Aphids harbor an ancient coevolved intracellular symbiont, called Buchnera.</s><s>We used the newly available sequence of the pea aphid genome to conduct an exhaustive computational search for genes of bacterial ancestry.</s><s>We found that no functional genes have been transferred from Buchnera, ruling out such transfer as a driving force in genome reduction in this symbiont.</s><s>However, the aphid genome does contain eight transcribed genes of apparent bacterial origin, some of which have been duplicated after transfer.</s><s>Based on their expression patterns, most of these appear to function specifically in the aphid-Buchnera symbiosis, presenting the possibility that the maintenance of obligate intracellular symbioses can be affected by the acquisition and duplication of genes transferred from unrelated bacterial lineages.</s></p><p><s>subjected to BLASTN searches against the A. pisum genome assembly (Acyr_1.0),</s><s>revealing 21 reads with regions similar (BLASTN bit score $55) to the pea aphid genome.</s><s>However, none of these reads exhibited features of LGT; that is, they did not exhibit distinct regions with similarity to the Buchnera and aphid genomes respectively.</s><s>Thus, we concluded that the precluded reads contain no evidence for laterally transferred genes.</s></p></div>
