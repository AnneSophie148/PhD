<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Presence of similar glycoconjugate patterns at the surface of midgut and salivary gland cells of E. variegatus and S. titanus.</s><s>To determine which carbohydrates are present at the surfaces of the two main barriers that phytoplasmas must cross, that is, the luminal surface of midgut epithelial cells and the basal surface of salivary gland cells, we determined the binding capacity to these organs exhibited by fluorescent lectins with different specificities.</s><s>The lectins utilized in this study, as listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, were DBA-and VVA-binding glycoproteins containing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), PNA-and RCA-binding glycoproteins with β1,4and β1,3-galactose, respectively, WGA-and LEL-binding glycoproteins with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), GNA-binding glycoproteins containing mannose (Man), and LCA-binding glycoproteins containing Man or glucose (Glc).</s><s>After E. variegatus ingested the fluorescent lectins, their retention in the midgut lumen showed that the apical surface of the midgut was glycosylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>A very weak fluorescent signal was observed along the gut lumen when fluorescent DBA and PNA lectins were used.</s><s>The RCA lectin bound to glycoconjugates present in the filter chamber or close to it, but no fluorescence was detected in the midgut of E. variegatus.</s><s>Stronger and more extensive labeling of the midgut was observed when the insects ingested VVA, WGA, LEL, GNA and LCA lectins, often including the filter chamber.</s><s>Very similar results were obtained when midguts of S. titanus were observed using fluorescence microscopy after ingestion of these various lectins (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1  online)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The salivary glands of both insect vectors were dissected and incubated with the same fluorescent lectins.</s><s>The results show that the salivary gland cells of E. variegatus are differentially labeled according to the cell type and lectin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The lectin PNA bound the salivary gland cells very poorly.</s><s>The DBA, VVA and RCA lectins bound only one cell type that was different depending on the lectin and could be differentiated by their size and actin network.</s><s>The WGA lectin primarily fixed only two cell types that were distinguished by their size and labeling with the fluorescent lectin.</s><s>This labeling was uniform at the surface of the first cell type, as indicated by arrows, and was restricted to structures in a network on the second cell type, as indicated by arrowhead.</s><s>Finally, the LEL, GNA and LCA lectins fixed the surface of all the salivary glands somewhat abundantly, depending on the cell type.</s><s>Similar results were obtained with the salivary glands of S. titanus (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 online)</ref>, except that the DBA lectin did not label any cell, and the PNA lectin was fixed to one cell type.</s><s>These results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>The two primary main differences between E. variegatus and S. titanus were the labeling of E. variegatus midgut and salivary glands with the DBA lectin, which was not observed in S. titanus, and the labeling of S. titanus salivary glands with the PNA lectin, which was not observed in E. variegatus.</s></p><p><s>Colonization by FD phytoplasmas of salivary gland cells with glycoproteins interacting with GNA, LCA and LEL lectins.</s><s>To correlate FDP colonization and lectin binding, the salivary glands of FDPinfected E. variegatus were labeled with the same lectins as for the healthy insects and were observed using laser scanning microscopy.</s><s>In this experiment, no difference was observed between the salivary glands of infected insects and those of noninfected insects (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>No staining was observed with the lectin PNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for noninfected insects, and not shown for infected insects).</s><s>The cells labeled with the lectins DBA, VVA, RCA and WGA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, arrowhead) were determined not to be infected or to be infected very rarely at low rates for DBA, VVA and RCA and at higher rates for WGA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, arrow).</s><s>In contrast, salivary gland cells stained with the fluorescent lectins LEL, GNA and LCA were observed to be infected by phytoplasmas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained when FDP-infected salivary glands of S. titanus were observed (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> online), and these findings are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>When the salivary glands were observed at high magnification, patches of phytoplasmas could be visualized near carbohydrates bound to GNA, LCA, and LEL at the surface of the cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>In the case of the LEL and LCA lectins, dense labeling was observed close to the phytoplasmas.</s><s>These aggregates were not observed on the salivary gland cells of noninfected insects (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), suggesting that the adhesion of FDPs at the surface of these cells induced a gathering of glycoproteins recognized by the LEL and LCA lectins.</s><s>Once the phytoplasmas had crossed the basal membrane, they grouped close to reticulated structures resembling apical membranes, as described by Koinuma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Phytoplasmas were detected around (indicated by arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) and inside (indicated by an arrowhead in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) these intracellular structures, which were labeled through actin staining.</s><s>In some cells, GNA bound these membranes where phytoplasmas gathered.</s><s>These structures were not labeled or very poorly labeled with the LEL and LCA lectins.</s></p></div>

of the digestive tract and salivary glands often requires the recognition of glycoconjugates by lectin-like adhesins.</s><s>Numerous examples have been described in the literature, and some of them will be detailed below in the discussion.</s><s>Indeed, in insects, the salivary gland surface and the midgut perimicrovillar membrane are highly glycosylated <ref type="bibr"

carbohydrates of E. variegatus and S. titanus midguts labeled with fluorescent lectins were Man, GalNAc and GlcNAc, as observed for the perimicrovillar membrane of the insect Triatoma (Meccus) pallidipennis, except for GlcNAc <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Labeling of carbohydrates at the surfaces of salivary glands, although highly similar, showed slight variations between E. variegatus and S. titanus, suggesting some differences in glycoconjugate carbohydrate composition.</s><s>Variations in glycoconjugate carbohydrate composition were previously observed among different arthropods and even among different species of the same genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref>

yellows phytoplasmas and types III, IV and V of E. variegatus in the case of FD phytoplasmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> .</s><s>We also observed that FDP did not colonize all the different types of E. variegatus and S. titanus salivary gland cells.</s><s>FDP rarely colonized cells containing carbohydrates that link the lectins DBA, VVA and RCA.</s><s>In contrast, FDP colonized cells recognized by LEL, GNA and LCA lectins.</s><s>Moreover, LEL, GNA and LCA were the lectins that more extensively bound the apical surface of the midgut.</s><s>Therefore, it was hypothesized that at least one FDP adhesin may act as a lectin with Man and GlcNAc affinity.</s><s>The localization in patches of the LEL lectin at the surface of Euva-6 cells resembled the pattern of VmpA-coated bead adhesion to these cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>This finding prompted us to hypothesize that VmpA could be an adhesin with lectin activity.</s></p><p><s>Our results obtained in vitro with the adhesin VmpA confirmed this hypothesis.</s><s>Phytoplasmas internalize in the midgut, which is not covered with a chitin tegument, in contrast to the foregut and hindgut.</s><s>GlcNAc, the carbohydrate monomer composing chitin, was investigated in this study, as it is a core component of N-glycosylation.</s><s>Chitin degradation products other than GlcNac, such as glucosamine-composed chitobiose and chitotriose, were not examined in our study.</s><s>Adhesion to Man or GlcNAc was previously documented for several pathogens invading host cells from arthropods to mammals.</s><s>For example, Xylella fastidiosa possesses the afimbrial adhesins HxfA and HxfB and the protein PD1764, which bind GlcNAc residues and chitin of on the foregut cuticle of its insect vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .</s><s>Inhibition assays with GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2 or (GlcNAc)3 and lectins with affinity for GlcNAc showed that attachment of Xylella to GlcNAc is required for the transmission of the bacterium by its vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> .</s><s>In the case of Trypanosoma, diverse lectin-like adhesins appear to be involved in the attachment of the parasite to both midgut and salivary gland barriers of their insect vectors.</s><s>Incubation of Trypanosoma cruzi with Man and, to a lesser extent, with GlcNAc and Gal decreased the adhesion of T. cruzi to the PMM of Rhodnius prolixus <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> .</s><s>For Trypanosoma rangeli, inhibition assays with GlcNAc decreased the attachment of parasites to the salivary glands of R. prolixus but not Man <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Similar interactions were found in mammals, where enteric carbohydrates also function as receptors for bacteria.</s><s>For instance, the adhesin FimH of Escherichia coli type 1 fimbriae binds mannose <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> and, as it is highly expressed on the bacterial surface, the FimH-mannose interaction enables a large part of the bacterial surface to adhere to epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We showed that adding Man as a potential inhibitor surprisingly increased the adhesion of VmpA to Euva-6 cells and Euva-6 proteins, contrary to GlcNAc, which inhibited the interaction of VmpA with insect proteins.</s><s>The adhesion of Man to VmpA may induce a change in VmpA conformation, which could result in oligomerization of the adhesin.</s><s>Indeed, when we mixed VmpA-His 6 -coated beads with Man, we observed aggregation of the beads (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5 online</ref>).</s><s>One could argue that the phenomenon of VmpA oligomerization could be responsible for the increased detection of VmpA using ELISA tests (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>); however, this oligomerization could also induce a cooperative effect on the binding of VmpA to GlcNAc.</s><s>Oligomerization is a common trait of lectins <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, autoaggregation of bacterial adhesins has been observed previously.</s><s>For example, the adhesins TibA and AIDA-I are able to mediate adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli to epithelial cells and autoaggregation of the bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> .</s><s>The autoaggregation of VmpA following their binding to the surface of salivary gland cells could explain the colony-like structures of FD phytoplasmas observed during the invasion process.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the presence of carbohydrates Man and GlcNAc at the surfaces of the midgut and salivary glands and the sensitivity of VmpA binding to Man and GlcNAc support the hypothesis that insect glycans may serve as recognition sites for the adhesin VmpA.</s><s>The identification of the insect protein(s) interacting with VmpA may confirm this hypothesis and help to characterize the specificity of FD phytoplasma transmission by vectoring leafhoppers.</s><s>Recent ecological and genetic surveys have correlated variations in VmpA sequences to the ability of phytoplasma vectotypes to be transmitted by vectors of different leafhopper subfamilies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>However, preliminary data suggest that VmpA sequence variations do not fully explain the lack of transmission of FDP vectotype I by S. titanus.</s><s>Variations on the insect side at the level of the VmpA target should be investigated.</s><s>As glycoconjugate carbohydrate composition was sometimes found to be different between diverse species in the same genus, it could be hypothesized that there is a correlation between the carbohydrate composition of insect vector glycoproteins binding VmpA and the ability of these leafhoppers to transmit FDPs.</s><s>Identifying leafhopper glycoproteins binding VmpA could also facilitate the development of novel strategies to block FDP transmission.</s></p></div>
