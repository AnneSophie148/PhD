a successful biocontrol agent may need to not only enter the phloem but colonize it as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</s><s>Although direct phloem entry has not been reported (to the best of our knowledge), we propose that Bacillus-derived biomolecules may permeate from the xylem and associated cells into the phloem.</s><s>Further, endophytes are considered ideal candidates for biological control precisely for this reason: their marked ability to colonize an ecological niche similar to that of plant pathogens (including vascular pathogens) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, in order to increase the likelihood of recolonization, the present study aimed to isolate endophytes residing in a niche similar to that of CLas (citrus stem tissue), though it may not have been specifically from the phloem alone.</s><s>Moreover, the isolated endophytes were native to citrus (in an organic orchard), and thus, the reintroduction of these endophytes into citrus groves would be unlikely to have any environmental risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to these advantages, each of the isolates demonstrating significant activity against CLas are likely B. amyloliquefaciens species; given that Bacillus have the ability to colonize internal plant tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and that B. amyloliquefaciens are among the most successful biological control agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, our results are encouraging.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the five strains of B. amyloliquefaciens identified in the present study hold significant potential to become the first sustainable anti-CLas treatment agents for HLB control.</s><s>In addition, given that B. amyloliquefaciens may induce the immune responses of HLB-infected citrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref> and that in the present study five strains of B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity directly against CLas, it is possible that B. amyloliquefaciens may actually provide dual-benefits (both direct and indirect) simultaneously to their citrus host trees.</s><s>Nevertheless, given the complexities of the Bacillus phylogeny and the limitations of species identification based on 16S rRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, as well as the fact that numerous strains of antimicrobial-producing B. amyloliquefaciens species have already been documented, additional sequence analyses (whole genome) are needed for complete taxonomic identification of each of these five anti-CLas isolates.</s></p><p><s>Huanglongbing has led to permanent changes in the management practices of citrus globally.</s><s>Since Florida citrus trees are already infected, efficient management requires effective and sustainable treatment options to help infected trees maintain health and productivity.</s><s>To accomplish this, citrus growers should have access to a diverse set of effective HLB prevention and mitigation tools.</s><s>As such, endophytes offer remarkable potential for the discovery and development of novel anti-CLas therapeutics with multiple modes of action to reduce resistance.</s><s>Further, an endophyte-based bioactive product for biological control of HLB would constitute a novel sustainable treatment option for citrus growers, promoting long-term disease suppression and reducing the need for chemical inputs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>The availability of sustainable HLB management options is critical to the survival of the citrus industry.</s><s>Still, despite extensive efforts, citrus production continues to plummet.</s><s>The development of effective treatment options has been hindered by the fastidious nature of the CLas pathogen, limiting experimental methods primarily to the use of surrogate organisms and in planta studies.</s><s>In the present study, the sequential use of two surrogate organisms led to the selection of five high-potential anti-CLas candidates, which were evaluated directly against CLas in vitro, under a v-qPCR-based psyllid homogenate assay.</s><s>Here, we measured the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity (produced by the endophytic isolates) against CLas.</s><s>The CFCS of five endophytic strains of B. amyloliquefaciens were each found to statistically reduce the number of intact CLas cells when compared to the control.</s><s>While these results are promising, they entail the need for further exploration.</s><s>Future studies require the identification and characterization of the bioactive fractions in the CFCS as well as in planta analysis of both the bacterial suspensions and their bioactive fractions.</s><s>All in all, stems from organically managed survivor citrus trees were found to harbor CLasantagonistic endophytes as part of their aboveground microbiome.</s><s>As such, these naturally derived anti-CLas agents hold significant potential for HLB management, potentially increasing yield and productivity while reducing environmental impacts.</s><s>Finally, an effective anti-CLas agent capable of entering the host's vascular tissue could provide a unique opportunity for growers to become more sustainable in their management practices and ameliorate the crisis of the citrus industry.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Leaf disks from HLB-symptomatic trees were submerged in 200 ÂµL of treatment solution for 48 h.</s><s>Treatments included a no-treatment control, streptomycin, oregano (Origanum vulgare), Christmas bush (Alchornea cordifolia), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), cinnamon (Cinnamomum aromaticum), and turmeric (Curcuma longa).</s><s>Leaf disks were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder for phenol extraction (Tris-EDTA buffer solution), followed by qPCR with CLas sequence-specific primers (LL, Las-Long).</s><s>Results are shown as mean Ct values for CLas with standard error of the mean.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
