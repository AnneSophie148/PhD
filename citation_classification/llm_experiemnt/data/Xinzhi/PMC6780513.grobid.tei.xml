allowing her offspring a means to escape from the non-ideal conditions the mother aphid is currently facing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Given the telescopic development of aphids (granddaughter present as an embryo nested within a developing daughter nested inside the adult mother), it is of interest if these environmental cues perceived by the mother can also be inherited by the granddaughter.</s><s>Previous work has shown that environmentally induced-winged daughters, cannot themselves react to the environment, and will lay non-winged offspring, regardless of any environmental cues they may experience as an adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>So, if stressors processed by a mother can be passed not only to the daughter, but also to her granddaughter, we would not expect to see this through a proxy like wing development, but perhaps the effects of this transgenerational stress can be observed in another way, such as developmental timing.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we demonstrate that cues triggered by transgenerational stress can be inherited by the granddaughter and can result in developmental defects such as a delay in the timing of events such as nymph laying.</s><s>During each trial in this study, it was noted if an adult was winged or non-winged when recording the time, she laid her first offspring.</s><s>When comparing the developmental time of winged versus non-winged females reared under the same condition it was observed that independent of the diet treatment and/or rearing condition, winged females always took significantly longer to lay nymphs than their non-winged counterparts.</s><s>However, our data also suggests that transgenerational stress can also lead to a delay in development, independent of the delay caused by winged females taking longer to develop.</s><s>While "Stressed" granddaughters took a similar amount of time to complete nymphal development as "WT" granddaughters, they took significantly longer to lay nymphs.</s><s>In this study, the induction of winged females was actually lower in aphids whose grandparents were exposed to stress than those not, so the observed delay in nymph laying cannot be explained by a higher proportion of the slower developing winged morphs.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that while small, the response triggered by past stressors is still inherited by the granddaughters, perhaps through epigenetic changes (JH binding protein gene is highly methylated in winged offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>), and these changes result in physical or behavioral changes that prolong development (reproductive maturity) of both alate and apterous females.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>In summary, this study characterized the nymphal and pre-reproductive developmental period of the commonly used laboratory strain of A. pisum, LSR1, as it develops on it universal host-plant (V.</s><s>faba), common non-natural diets (isolated leaf samples and artificial liquid diets), and under sup-optimal rearing conditions that could potentially occur (older host plant, trans-generationally inherited stress from overcrowding and low host plant vigor).</s><s>Unexpected levels of intra-treatment variation in the timing of these developmental events was observed in all diet treatments, as was significant inter-treatment variation, leading to strong developmental delays when feeding on non-natural diets and weaker delays when reared under sub-optimal conditions (older plant, stressful conditions).</s><s>Therefore, if not tightly controlled, commonly used experimental conditions such as diet choice, diet quality, and the environment of the mother and grandmother can influence the timing of these developmental events, necessitating that these artificially caused fluctuations must be accounted for before determining the effects caused by other experimental variables.</s><s>Finally, given that molting and nymph laying time frames are dependent on diet and environmental rearing conditions, additional confirmations (molt counting, siphunculus measuring) are vital if accurate developmental staging is required or important in the experimental design.</s></p></div>
