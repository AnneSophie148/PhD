addition, the pathogen can be transmitted by contaminated insects to healthy plants.</s><s>All together, these data demonstrate that the insects could vector the bacterium from plant to plant.</s><s>However, the number of infected insects feeding on a plant, rather than their bacterial load, is determinant for the disease transmission.</s><s>Therefore, low transmission efficiency may be hypothesized from M. pruinosa, while a high number of feeding events would increase the chance of infection.</s><s>This is particularly important in the light of M. pruinosa's gregarious behavior.</s></p><p><s>The negative correlation between infected insect percentage and days of feedings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) may be due to the low viability of the bacteria in artificial solution or to the activity of insect immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Vilmos and Kuruoz, 1998)</ref>, which may produce several antimicrobial compounds, as shown for bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gätschenbergar et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, the apparent increase observed after 9 days of feeding is possibly linked to the insect's growth in weight, which positively correlates with the bacterial population hosted by the vector (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Ecological factors related to Psa spread.</s><s>Specific features of bacterial strains and environmental conditions may influence several aspects of the vector-pathogen-host interaction, by affecting pathogen multiplication in source hosts, pathogen multiplication within vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Feil and Purcell 2001)</ref>, vector behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Su and Mulla, 2001)</ref>, or movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vail and Smith, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the transmission of Psa via puncturing insects is not influenced by the number and status of generally acknowledged infection routes, such as stomata, flowers and wounds, and may be overlooked by common orchard protection measures.</s><s>One of the symptoms of the bacterial canker of kiwifruit consists in droplets or masses of sticky exudate (ooze) on the surface of host tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Donati et al., 2014)</ref> which could stick on the limbs and bodies of visiting insects.</s><s>In natural conditions, the sugars in the bacterial exudate may attract M. pruinosa and other insects as a food source, making them possible vectors of the bacteria contained in the same exudates <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrios, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, M. pruinosa itself produces a sugary honeydew that may smear the plant surface and attract other insects.</s><s>If Psa could be detected in this secretion, it may contribute further to Psa dispersion.</s><s>Besides its feeding behavior, M. pruinosa could carry pathogens externally on their bodies after the contact with infected plant tissue or bacterial ooze (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>Oviposition is another crucial stage in the biological cycle of M. pruinosa, consisting in the mechanical injection of the eggs in host tissues.</s><s>Since oviposition takes place from September to October, when the weather conditions are still favorable for the development of the bacterial canker, it may significantly contribute to the spread of Psa.</s></p><p><s>Insect developmental stage and vectoring ability.</s><s>The insects' developmental phase may affect their immune system efficiency, with juvenile stages more exposed to bacterial contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gätschenbergar et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, previous studies on several leafhopper species suggested that vector age did not influence their vectoring capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chiykowski and Sinha 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Murral et al., 1996)</ref>, or that slight differences were due to the amount of sap ingested <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Palermo et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In this work, field and laboratory observations yielded contrasting evidence on Psa incidence in relation to developmental stage.</s><s>Thus, environmental conditions, such as temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Murral et al., 1996)</ref>, water availability, and their effects on Psa and host plants, rather than insect physiology, may be responsible for the observed differences.</s></p><p><s>Applicative remark.</s><s>The ecological importance of M. pruinosa as a vector of Psa in field conditions has not yet been evaluated.</s><s>In particular, the production of infected honeydew, the attraction of M. pruinosa by bacterial exudates and the survival of the pathogen inside and outside M. pruinosa in different climatic conditions require further research.</s><s>However, our results demonstrated the capacity of M. pruinosa to vector the disease in controlled conditions.</s><s>Thus, the control of M. pruinosa and, possibly, other pests is suggested to minimize the risk of Psa diffusion.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1
