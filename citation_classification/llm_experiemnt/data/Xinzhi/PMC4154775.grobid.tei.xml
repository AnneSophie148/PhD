<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics Statement</head><p><s>Because the small brown planthopper L. striatellus is a serious and destructive pest of agriculture in the temperate zone in China, no permits were required for collecting the insect and performing the experiments.</s><s>All experiments were carried out at the Institute of Entomology, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province (28u469 N, 115u499 E).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Materials and Insect Rearing Conditions</head><p><s>The original colony of L. striatellus was collected from the rice fields in the suburbs of Nanchang (28.8u</s><s>N, 115.9u</s><s>E), Jaingxi Province.</s><s>Under local conditions the planthopper exhibits mixed voltinism from four to seven generations per year due to the differences in the diapause intensity of overwintering nymphs and the long ovipositional period of females and overwinters as 1-5 instar nymphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, nymphs in the overwintered and the first generations were raised with stems of American sloughgrass, Beckmannia syzigache; nymphs in the other generations were raised with rice stems.</s><s>The planthoppers were reared at 25uC under LD 15:9 (a diapause-averting photoperiod) for several generations before use.</s></p><p><s>Approximately 50 newly hatched nymphs were put in a glass tube (length: 180 mm; diameter: 32 mm) with stems of American sloughgrass or rice stems, and exposed to different photoperiods and temperatures to observe diapause induction.</s><s>In the diapause termination experiments, diapausing nymphs were placed in glass tubes with rice stems and they were exposed to different photoperiods and temperatures to observe diapause termination.</s></p><p><s>All laboratory experiments were performed in illuminated incubators (LRH-250-GS, Guangdong Medical Appliances Plant, Guangdong, China) equipped with four fluorescent 30 W tubes with an irradiance of approximately 1.97 W m 22 and the variation in the temperatures was 61uC.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diapause Induction Experiments</head><p><s>Photoperiodic Response.</s><s>The photoperiodic responses for diapause induction in L. striatellus were experimentally determined under various photoperiods at constant temperatures of 18, 20, 22 and 25uC.</s><s>The influence of unnatural photoperiods (including continuous darkness (DD) and continuous light (LL)) on diapause induction was also examined at 20uC.</s><s>Diapausing individuals were easy to identify because nymphs entered diapause in 3-4th instars and showed a distinct developmental delay.</s><s>Thus, the incidence of diapause was determined based on the proportion of nymphs that were still in 3-4th instars within one week after comparable control cultures had completed emergence because the nymphs has stopped development and were almost not feeding during this period.</s><s>There were 39-129 individuals in each of three replicates for most treatments; a few treatments had two or more than three replicates.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Diapause-inducing Photoperiod and Temperature on Diapause Intensity</head><p><s>The diapause-inducing photoperiod had a significant effect on diapause intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>The duration of diapause induced by a photoperiod of LD 12:12 was significantly shorter than that of LD 11:13 at 20uC and shorter than those of LD 10:14 and LD 11:13 at 22uC (x 2 = 80.39, d.f.</s><s>= 8, P,0.05), whereas diapause-inducing temperature had no significant effect on diapause intensity at different photoperiods (P.0.05).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Diapause-terminating Photoperiod and Temperature on Diapause Intensity</head><p><s>Diapause ended even at a short daylength of LD 11:13; however, the duration of diapause was significantly longer under the short daylength of LD 11:13 (35 days) than it was under the long daylengths of LD 15:9 (26 days) (t = 8.97, d.f.</s><s>= 63, P,0.01) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), indicating that long photoperiods can accelerate diapause development.</s></p><p><s>In addition, diapause-terminating temperature significantly influenced the diapause intensity (x 2 = 711.42,</s><s>d.f.</s><s>= 7, P,0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>The duration of diapause was gradually shortened from 25 days at 18 to 11 days at 28uC.</s><s>Furthermore, the eclosion was less synchronous at 18uC than it was at other temperatures which resulted in changes in the mean, but a substantial proportion of the individuals still eclosed between 10-20 days.</s><s>However, at the high temperatures of 30 and 32uC, the duration of diapause was significantly longer than the durations at the temperatures of 22, 24, 26 and 28uC.</s><s>This result indicates that the optimal temperature for diapause termination is in the 26-28uC range.</s><s>Figure 5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Course of Diapause Termination under Field Conditions</head><p><s>The cumulative eclosion rate of the naturally overwintering nymphs is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>.</s><s>A few overwintering nymphs began to emerge on 27 March 2012 and 5 March in 2013 when the mean daily temperature rose to 10uC or higher.</s><s>A proportion of 50% eclosion occurred on 4 April 2012 and on 20 March 2013, showing a 15 day difference.</s><s>This is most likely because the mean daily temperature in March was 2.8uC lower in 2012 (10.6uC) than it was 2013 (13.4uC).</s><s>It suggests that the temperatures in March determine the rate of post-diapause development in the planthopper.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The photoperiodic response for diapause induction in L. striatellus highly depended on temperature.</s><s>The critical daylength decreased with an increase in temperature from 18 to 25uC (11 h at 25uC, 12 h at 22 and 20uC and 12.5 h at 18uC; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The critical daylength could not be determined at the high temperature of 28uC because this temperature significantly weakened and even completely inhibited the photoperiodic induction of diapause (more than 90% of the individuals developed without diapause under short daylengths) However, it is important to note that the critical daylengths of 11 h at 25uC and 12 h at 22 and 20uC do not exist in the Nanchang region.</s><s>In Nanchang, the longest period of daylight in a year is approximately 14 h 56 min (including twilight), the shortest is 11 h 9 min.</s><s>Therefore, an 11 h daylength occurs in late winter and a 12 h daylength occurs at the end of October.</s><s>Apparently, the critical daylengths at 20, 22 and 25uC were not suitable to analyze the incidence of diapause in the field.</s><s>Only the critical daylength of 12.5 h at 18uC was related to diapause induction in the field because this result was consistent with the photoperiod experienced by nymphs entering diapause in the field (12 h 10 min-12 h 32 min; Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Our results indicate that the nymphs entered winter diapause in response to short daylengths and low temperatures during autumn, which is consistent with the result reported by Kisimoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The photoperiodic response curve at 20uC in L. striatellus showed a gradual decline in diapause incidence during ultra-long nights (from 16 h nightlength to 22 h nightlength) and DD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), suggesting that different long nights have different inductive effects.</s><s>This phenomenon has been found in many long-day insect species, such as the large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the fly, Chymomyza costata <ref type="bibr"

<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>That ultra-long nights and DD result in a decline in diapause incidence presumably reflects the absence of selective pressure, but it may have a physiological significance when one attempts to determine the mechanism of time measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One basic concept concerning photoperiodic responses in insects is the RDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that a greater number of exposure days is required for the induction of diapause than are required for its termination <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This has been indicated in species as diverse as the mosquito Aedes atropalpus, the aphid Megoura viciae, the cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae, the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana, the Asian swallowtail Papilio xuthus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and the zygaenid moth Pseudopidorus fasciata <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and D. punctatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The transfer experiments in L. striatellus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) showed that the RDN for short nights was three times less than for that long nights at 18uC (cf.</s><s>6 days vs. 18 days), indicating that short nights are photoperiodically more potent.</s></p><p><s>The intensity of diapause dose not only vary between species but also among individuals of the same species depending on how long they have been exposed to diapause-inducing and terminating conditions <ref

diapause induced by a photoperiod of LD 12:12 was significantly shorter than those by LD 10:14 and LD 11:13 at 20 and 22uC (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Similar results have been reported for a number of insects, such as the fruit flies, Drosophila auraria, D. subauraria, D. triauraria, the bean bug, Riptortus clavatus, the Mediterranean tiger moth, Cymbalophora pudica and the cotton

type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, where photoperiods with longer scotophases induced more intense diapause compared with shorter scotophases.</s><s>Our results further showed that the duration of diapause in L. striatellus was significantly affected by the photoperiod during diapause.</s><s>By transferring diapausing nymphs to a short photoperiod of LD 11:13 and a long photoperiod of LD 15:9 combined with 18uC, diapause was terminated significantly faster at LD 15:9 than it was at LD 11:13 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), suggesting that short daylengths may play a role in maintaining winter diapause.</s><s>Similar results have also been reported for the mulberry tiger moth Spilarctia imparilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, the lacewing Chrysopa downesi <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and the cabbage butterfly Pieris melete, where long photoperiods during diapause significantly accelerated winter diapause development.</s></p><p><s>Increasing

in L. striatellus.</s><s>The rate of diapause completion was positively related to the temperature increase between 18 and 28uC.</s><s>However, diapause development was delayed when the temperature rose to 30 and 32uC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>This result suggests that the optimal temperature for diapause development is 26 and 28uC in L. striatellus.</s><s>The chilling experiments in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> showed that the eclosion time of diapausing nymphs was significantly postponed with an increase in chilling time if the time spent under chilling was considered as part of the duration of diapause development, indicating that chilling at 5uC did not shorten the duration of diapause but lengthened it.</s><s>Our results suggest that low temperatures during winter may serve primarily to maintain nymphal diapause and prevent the resumption of post-diapause morphogenesis, which in turn synchronizes the adult emergence of the overwintering generation with the availability of host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A few studies have examined diapause induction and termination under field
