<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSMV Particles Accumulated Around the Viroplasm in RSMV-Infected Insect VCMs</head><p><s>To study the localization of RSMV in viruliferous insects, we first developed RSMV N antibody which recognized a 54.4 kDa protein present in protein extracts from viruliferous insects rather than protein from non-viruliferous insects, confirming that RSMV N antibody specifically recognized RSMV N protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Next, RSMV infection and localization in VCMs was studied using immunofluorescence and western blot.</s><s>The results showed that N protein localized to punctate inclusions in the cytoplasm of VCMs of R. dorsalis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) and the protein accumulation of N were increased gradually (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that RSMV has successfully infected in VCMs of R. dorsalis.</s><s>Meanwhile, electron microscopy observations showed that the non-enveloped bacilliform virions were assembled into blocks and localized around the electron-dense viroplasm in the cytoplasm of RSMV infected cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>, panel I), while none bacilliform virion or electron-dense viroplasm was found in mock-infected cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>We only observed the enveloped bacilliform virions outside the VCMs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>In addition, RSMV N antibodies specifically reacted with the matrix of the viroplasm and the bacilliform virions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that RSMV N was not only a structural protein of RSMV particle, but also a constituent of the matrix of viroplasm in RSMV-infected VCMs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infection Route of RSMV in Its Vector Insect as Revealed by Confocal Microscopy</head><p><s>In order to trace the infection route of RSMV in its vector, we first observed the anatomy of organs potentially involved in virus circulation in R. dorsalis by confocal microscopy.</s><s>R. dorsalis' alimentary canal was consisted of the esophagus, filter chamber, midgut, and hindgut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The suspensory ligament protruded from the surface of the filter chamber, paralleled along with the esophagus, and extended to the head.</s><s>The salivary gland, compound ganglionic mass, suspensory ligament, and brain connected together in the head (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>No signal for the RSMV antigen was observed in the intestine, salivary gland, and central nerve system from the R. dorsalis fed on healthy rice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Then, we observed the localization of RSMV-N protein in alimentary canal, salivary gland, and compound ganglionic mass of leafhoppers at different day post-first access to diseased plants (padp).</s><s>At 2-day padp, RSMV N antigen was observed in a few epithelial cells of the filter chamber in about 26% of the tested insects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>At 4-day padp, RSMV spread from the epithelial cells into the visceral muscle tissues of filter chamber in about 24% of the tested leafhoppers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), but not spread to the hemolymph (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>At 6-day padp, RSMV spread to the suspensory ligament in about 32% of leafhopper samples and to the salivary glands in about 8%, suggesting that RSMV can efficiently spread from suspensory ligament to salivary glands (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>,<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>Meanwhile, RSMV had spread from the filter chamber to the hidgut, midgut, and esophagus anterior in about 8, 12, and 8% of leafhoppers, respectively, but RSMV had not spread to the central nervous system (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>At this time, RSMV N antigen was observed in about 20% hemolymph of the viruliferous R. dorsalis (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>At 8-day padp, RSMV had spread to the suspensory ligament and salivary glands in a higher proportion of tested leafhoppers.</s><s>At this time, RSMV had spread to the central nervous system in about 20% of leafhoppers tested and 35% hemolymph of the viruliferous R. dorsalis (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>,<ref type="figure">G</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>At 12-day padp, RSMV had spread to the entire alimentary canal, salivary glands and central nervous system in about 36% of leafhoppers (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>,<ref type="figure">I</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Table 1</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>In the central nervous system, RSMV not only infected the compound ganglionic mass, but also distributed in the nerve cord (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results indicated that RSMV first accumulates in epithelial cells of the filter chamber, procedes to the visceral muscles surrounding the filter chamber, and then spreads throughout the suspensory ligament to salivary glands (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, RSMV spreads simultaneously from the filter chamber to midgut, hindgut, To further determine whether RSMV could be transovarially transmitted to insect offspring, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to trace RSMV N antigens in the reproductive system of leafhoppers at 20-day padp.</s><s>RSMV-N antigens were observed on the surface cells of reproductive system: in the ovarioles and oviduct of females or the testis, accessory gland, and seminal vesicle of males, but did not appear in cytoplasm of the oocyte or cavity of the testis and seminal vesicle (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we traced RSMV-N antigens in the offspring of viruliferous leafhoppers with immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR.</s><s>However, no signal for the RSMV antigen was observed in the intestine, salivary gland, and central nerve system from the offspring of R. dorsalis.</s><s>Meanwhile, RSMV could not be detected in the offspring from RSMV positive females R. dorsalis by RT-PCR (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our findings suggested that the inability of R. dorsalis to transmit RSMV to offspring (Yang  et al., 2017b) could be due to the ovary barrier that restricted viral dissemination into the oocyte.</s></p></div>

type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>These results provide direct evidence that RSMV replicates in cytoplasm and the N protein is not only a component of virus particle, but also a component of the viroplasm matrix.</s></p><p><s>RSMV as an insect-borne propagative plant virus has the potential to seriously threaten the stability of rice production in China <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, characterization of the viral infection and transmission mechanisms in insect are significant for designing strategies to interfere with viral transmission.</s><s>Recently, the transmission biology of rice stripe mosaic virus by the leafhopper R. dorsalis has been investigated <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>However, the infection mechanism of RSMV in the leafhopper vector is still unknown.</s><s>Our work provides the direct evidence for the infection route of RSMV in various organs and tissues of its insect vector R. dorsalis using immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy.</s><s>Our results showed that epithelial cells of the filter chamber were susceptible to RSMV infection as early as 2 days padp, suggesting that the epithelial cells of the filter chamber were the initial infection sites for RSMV entry and accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>This finding revealed a similar initial infection site for other phytoreoviruses, such as rice dwarf virus (RDV) and rice gall dwarf virus, in the body of their leafhopper vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zheng et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, the initial infection site for other member of rhabdovirus, such as barley yellow striate mosaic virus and maize mosaic virus were hidgut and midgut of their vector planthoppers, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ammar and Hogenhout, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cao et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>These difference indicated that every persistentpropagative plant virus has a tissue tropism of virus entry among vector insect.</s><s>Usually, after replicated in initially infected cells, persistent-propagative viruses need to be transported across the epithelial cells in gut to salivary glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hogenhout et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have demonstrated that viruses used different routes, such as hemocoel, neurotropic, tracheae, visceral muscles, or ligament-like tissue, to directly or indirectly spread into the salivary glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Romoser et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar and Hogenhout, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jia et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Montero-Ast√∫a et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>With regard to RSMV, infection of the suspensory ligament of R. dorsalis was much more extensive and occurred much earlier than that of other tissues.</s><s>In addition, as early as 6 days padp, RSMV spread from the epithelial cells to the visceral muscle tissues of the filter chamber (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), from where they moved along the suspensory ligament to the salivary glands (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>,<ref type="figure">E</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We speculate that RSMV may have evolved to avoid transmission barriers in R. dorsalis by proceeding to salivary glands via the suspensory ligament.</s><s>These results also indicated that the minimum latent period of RSMV in R. dorsalis was 6 days which was consistent with the previous report <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, RSMV only infected the surface cells of the reproductive system of R. dorsalis, but did not infect into cytoplasm of the oocyte or cavity of the testis and seminal vesicle (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and did not transmit to the offspring leafhoppers (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>These results indicating that the failure of R. dorsalis to vertically transmit RSMV was due to the strong membrane or tissues barriers in the reproductive system.</s></p><p><s>As a plant infecting rhabdovirus, RSMV also could infect the compound ganglionic mass and nerve cord of the central nervous system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>).</s><s>The infection of RMSV in the nerve cord suggested that RSMV may proceed from the central nervous system to the closely associated tissues via the nerve cord.</s><s>This neurotropic characteristic is similar with that of some rhabdoviruses, such as rabies virus (an animal rhabdovirus infecting primates) and maize mosaic virus (a planthoppertransmitted nucleorhabdovirus; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar and Hogenhout, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ugolini, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, unlike rabies virus dissemination in the axon <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ugolini, 2011)</ref>, the enveloped RSMV particles only distributed and spread in the "myelin sheath" of the central nervous system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, unlike maize mosaic virus spread from the anterior diverticulum and esophagus to the salivary glands via the nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ammar and Hogenhout, 2008)</ref>, the infection of RSMV in the nervous system was later than in other tissues such as the suspensory ligament and salivary glands.</s><s>Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that RSMV uses a different mechanism to spread in the central nervous system, which substantially extends our understanding of the transmission mechanism of rhabdoviruses.</s></p><p><s>The vector specificity of plant viruses is common in nature, many plant viruses are transmitted by a specific or a few closely related insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hogenhout et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammar et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The specificity of a plant virus for its vector can be explained by transmission barriers posed by different tissues in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hogenhout et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>It has been demonstrated previously that RSMV is transmitted efficiently by R. dorsalis, and the closely related species N. cincticeps also can carry RSMV, but can't transmit it <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we found that the leafhopper N. virescens collected from the field exhibited a low RSMV-positive rate (‚àº10%).</s><s>And RSMV not only infected the alimentary canal, but also the salivary glands of N. virescens (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Particularly, transmission assays showed that the viruliferous N. virescens was able to transmit RSMV to healthy plants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We thus believe that N. virescens is a new vector for RSMV.</s><s>However, N. cincticeps, collected from Xinning, Guangdong and bred in laboratory for about 8 years, could not carry RSMV when fed on RSMV-infected rice plants for only 2 d.</s><s>According to the field survey of <ref type="bibr">Yang et al. (2017b)</ref> and our results, we deduced that N. cincticeps might need a longer viral acquisition access period to attain a lower acquisition rate, but could not transmit RSMV to healthy plants <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>Whether N. cincticeps is an additional vector of RSMV need further investigation.</s><s>In fact, leafhopper N. virescens can transmit RDV (family Reoviridae), rice yellow stunt virus (family Rhabdoviridae), and rice tungro-associated viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hsieh et al., 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xie et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hibino, 1983)</ref>.</s><s>It is also one of the dominating pests in winter rice field in Guangdong, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zhong et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we deduced that N. virescens might be one of the overwintering hosts and evolve to be an efficient vector for RSMV during the continued evolution.</s><s>Thus, close monitoring of the capability of N. virescens to transmit RSMV in field is necessary.</s></p><p><s>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2017J01435), and the FAFU Foundation for Outstanding Youth (XJQ201507).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Subcellular localization of protein N of RSMV in virus-infected VCMs.</s><s>(A) Western blot analyses of N protein.</s><s>Lane M, protein marker; lane 1, protein extracts from RSMV-infected leafhopper; lane 2, protein extracts from healthy leafhopper.</s><s>(B) Immunofluorescence staining of N-FITC (green) and DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (blue) revealed punctate inclusions in cytoplasm of RSMV-infected VCMs at 48 h p.i.
