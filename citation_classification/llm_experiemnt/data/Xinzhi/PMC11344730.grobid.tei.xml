type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mattedi et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Oppedisano et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Candian et al. 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we compared the phytoplasma acquisition efficiency of a high number of newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura (full siblings) from populations with high (Northwest Italy, NW) and low (Northeast Italy, NE) vector efficiency.</s><s>At the same time, we investigate the effect of the different 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' subtypes that are predominant in these areas.</s><s>Our results highlight the factors influencing the acquisition efficiencies of phytoplasma and show the ability of C. melanoneura populations from both regions to acquire different phytoplasma subtypes.</s></p><p><s>The natural infection in the overwintered C. melanoneura was slightly higher in individuals from NW than from NE.</s><s>However, the few individuals with a quantifiable amount of phytoplasma had on average similar concentrations.</s><s>These results are in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tedeschi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Oppedisano et al. 2019</ref>) and confirm once more that although C. melanoneura is not acknowledged as a vector in NE, overwintered individuals of natural population of C. melanoneura in both vector and non-vector regions harbored phytoplasma.</s></p><p><s>Data from the controlled acquisition experiment show that the infection rate in newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura developed on infected trees is driven mainly by the concentration and subtype of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' in the leaves, where 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' AT1-AO from NW was the most frequently acquired subtype.</s><s>The age of the infection might have played a role influencing the phytoplasma concentration in the leaves (all trees with AT1-AO and three trees with AT2 were grafted around 5 months before the experiment, whereas most of the plants with AT1 and AT2 from NE were prepared four years before).</s><s>The newly grafted plants with AT1-AO might not have had enough time to adapt to the phytoplasma infection and to activate defense mechanisms that prevent its migration from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Musetti et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Guerriero et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pagliari et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, since the three newly grafted AT2 plants had a similar concentration as the old ones, we assume that specific genetic features of AT1-AO from NW influenced the higher phytoplasma concentration in these plants, therefore favoring its acquisition by the psyllids.</s><s>To further investigate the hypothesis that the phytoplasma subtype is a driving factor for the acquisition, whole-genome sequencing experiments are necessary to provide a more precise classification and a functional characterization of the genes and proteins that mediate its interactions with the plant and the insect.</s><s>To date, little information is available about these 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' subtypes.</s><s>AT1 is prevalent in NW and is mostly associated with C. melanoneura, whereas AT2 is the main subtype in NE and is predominantly associated with C. picta <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cainelli et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Casati et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baric et al. 2011</ref>).</s><s>The classification in these studies was based only on a few conserved genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jarausch et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martini et al. 2007)</ref>, thus not providing any indication regarding the functional traits that might lead to a better colonization of the plant or a higher affinity to a specific species or population of Cacopsylla (i.e., C. picta vs. C. melanoneura, NW vs. NE populations).</s><s>Our preliminary results from wholegenome sequencing of different regional 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' subtypes suggest that the AT1 subtypes from NW and NE have two distinct genomes <ref type="bibr">(Calia et al., unpublished results)</ref>, highlighting the need for a better taxonomic classification of AP phytoplasmas.</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly, the percentage of infected newly emerged individuals of C. melanoneura reared on AP phytoplasma infected trees were similar among populations from high (NW) and low (NE) vector efficiency regions.</s><s>The infection rate of NW populations developed on trees infected with AT1-AO is slightly lower than the one measured in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Candian et al. (2020)</ref>.</s><s>However, the phytoplasma concentration observed in our study was around 10-times lower, probably due to the fact that they allowed the newly emerged adults a longer acquisition period (10 days vs. 30 days).</s><s>Our results further show that the phytoplasma concentration in the leaves had a higher positive influence on the acquisition in the populations from NW compared to NE.</s><s>This highlights that individuals from NW are able to acquire phytoplasma at a lower concentration in the leaves.</s><s>Thus, the role of newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura in low vector efficiency regions should not be underestimated.</s><s>Young adults might still be present in apple orchards in late spring, when phytoplasma has fully migrated from the roots and colonized the tree aerial part <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pedrazzoli et al. 2008)</ref>, thereby increasing their chance of feeding on an infected tree and acquiring phytoplasma.</s><s>A clear example was the V1 population from NE that acquired the phytoplasma subtype AT1-AO from NW very efficiently.</s><s>This population is from an area where the number of infected trees decreased significantly in the past years <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fischnaller et al. 2017</ref>); nevertheless, they were still able to acquire a phytoplasma subtype from a geographically distant region, where C. melanoneura is considered the only vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tedeschi et al. 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Together with the phytoplasma subtype and its concentration in the leaves, the psyllid lineage is another key factor driving phytoplasma acquisition.</s><s>In fact, while newly emerged siblings derived from a single mating couple of C. melanoneura had a similar infection status, we observed strong variation in the infectious status of psyllid lineages grown on the same tree (for example, tree 3 and 15).</s><s>All analyzed individuals either did not or did acquire phytoplasma with a comparable concentration, apart from a few individuals (especially in the BR and TN populations from NE) where only one or two siblings belonging to different lineages got infected.</s><s>Interestingly, when the newly emerged individuals of C. melanoneura developed on infected plants with negative leaves, meaning that the phytoplasma was still only located in the root system, only three out of the 942 analyzed psyllid individuals (0.3%) resulted positive.</s><s>This suggests that either the phytoplasma was present in the aerial parts of the tree at a very low concentration (below our detection limit) or was very unevenly distributed in the canopy, thus escaped detection.</s></p><p><s>After successful acquisition, the 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' concentration in the newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura was influenced by several factors.</s><s>The phytoplasma subtype played again a central role.</s><s>However, subtype AT1 from NE could reach higher concentrations, even though it was the least frequently acquired subtype.</s><s>This is clearly illustrated in the lineage Cmel-53 (ET) infected with subtype AT1 that harbored the highest concentration of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali'.</s><s>Even though AP outbreaks in the ET region were not as strong as in other areas of NE (Österreicher and Unterthurner 2014), AT1 is commonly found in this valley <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baric et al. 2011</ref>) and the possibility of C. melanoneura to carry such phytoplasma high concentrations should therefore not be underestimated.</s><s>Our results also show that the phytoplasma concentration in the leaves has no effect on the phytoplasma concentration in the psyllids.</s><s>Although the psyllid haplotype had a partial effect on the concentration in the insect, we could not identify a C. melanoneura haplotype that is related to a specific region or to a higher phytoplasma acquisition efficiency.</s><s>Nevertheless, the region of origin and the psyllid lineage had a clear influence on the phytoplasma concentration measured in the psyllids.</s><s>These results highlight that the genotype of the insect plays a role in the vector efficiency.</s><s>The use of a single COI marker used in this study might therefore not be enough to detect small-scale genetic differences of the insects, and therefore, future studies are needed to perform a comparative genomics and gene expression analyses between vector and non-vector populations.</s></p><p><s>Although the current study focused specifically on the acquisition part of the AP transmission cycle, another key step is the phytoplasma replication inside the insect vector and its subsequent transmission.</s><s>The pathogen multiplies inside the insect's salivary glands, and it should reach a certain density before it can be effectively transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sugio et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It was shown that phytoplasma can replicate and drastically increase its concentration inside C. melanoneura adults that had already migrated to conifers for the overwintering period, where the phytoplasma concentration reaches a plateau around five to eight months after migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Candian et al. 2020)</ref>.</s><s>In this work, the phytoplasma concentrations in overwintered psyllids from the field and some of the newly emerged adults from the acquisition experiment were close to the threshold concentration for phytoplasma transmission established in C. picta by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mayer et al. (2009)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, newly emerged adults from the populations ET and M carried relatively high phytoplasma concentrations and therefore, might have been able to transmit phytoplasma to healthy plants.</s><s>Previous studies showed that the concentration of phytoplasma in newly emerged psyllids reared on infected trees is higher compared to the concentration measured in overwintered individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oppedisano et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Candian et al. 2020)</ref>.</s><s>When comparing the transmission efficiency of phytoplasma in C. melanoneura to the other AP vector C. picta from NE, the concentration of the latter is around 10-times higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oppedisano et al. 2019)</ref>, thus suggesting a different type of interaction between 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' and the two psyllid species from this region.</s><s>The factors causing these discrepancies are currently not known.</s><s>A recent study showed that even though no significant differences were found between infected and noninfected individuals of C. melanoneura and C. picta from NE, a higher number of low-abundance bacterial taxa were observed in non-infected C. melanoneura than in the infected individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schuler et al. 2022)</ref>.</s><s>The opposite was true for the non-infected individuals of C. picta, which harbored a lower number of bacterial taxa compared to the infected individuals.</s><s>Psyllids with a high phytoplasma concentration had more divergent microbiomes and, most importantly, there was a significant difference between the microbiomes of C. melanoneura, C. picta and eight non-AP transmitting Cacopsylla species, highlighting the potential role of the microbiome in the acquisition and transmission of phytoplasmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schuler et al. 2022)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the microbiome of C. melanoneura from NW and its potential interaction with 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali'.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we demonstrate that newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura from both high (NW) and low (NE) vector efficiency regions were able to acquire phytoplasma from infected trees in similar numbers and concentrations.</s><s>The phytoplasma concentration in the leaves of the apple trees and the phytoplasma subtype drive the acquisition process in newly emerged adults of C. melanoneura, while the phytoplasma subtype and marginally the genetic features of the psyllid (region of origin, haplotype) affect how much phytoplasma is acquired and/or influence its replication kinetics within the insect body.</s><s>It is important to keep in mind that the acquisition of phytoplasma does not necessarily lead to a successful transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Tedeschi and Alma 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mayer</ref></s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 a</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 a Sampling locations in the region of Valle d'Aosta (Northwest Italy, NW): Aosta-AO1; Saint-Pierre-AO2 and in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige (Northeast Italy, NE): Brixen-BR; Bozen-BZ; Barbian (Eisacktal)-ET; Dorf Tirol (Meran)-M; San Michele all'Adige (Trentino)-TN; Schluderns (Vinschgau)-V1 and Mals</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,53.86,57.76,487.56,581.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
