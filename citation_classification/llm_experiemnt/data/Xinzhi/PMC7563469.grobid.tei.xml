<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Phytoplasmas are wall-less phytopathogenic prokaryotes transmitted by phloem-sucking insects in a persistent propagative manner and are associated with several diseases in both cultivated and wild plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The transmission of phytoplasmas is the result of an intricate interplay involving pathogens, insect vectors and host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Focusing on the vector, the complete transmission process is commonly divided into three phases: the acquisition period (the length of time a vector must feed on an infected plant to acquire sufficient phytoplasma to become infective), the latency period (the time interval in which phytoplasmas invade the insect body via the hemolymph, multiply and reach the salivary glands, leading the insect to become infective) and the inoculation period (the time required to transmit the phtoplasma to a healthy plant during feeding activity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The length of these phases (acquisition, latency, inoculation)-commonly ranging from a few hours to several days for the acquisition period, from 12 days to well over a month for the latency period and about a few hours for the inoculation period-are strongly influenced by several factors, such as the phytoplasma species/strain, the phytoplasma titer, the host plant, the vector species, gender, age and environmental factors such as temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Knowledge of the details of the transmission processes is of paramount importance for the management of the spread of the diseases, which is in most cases based on the control of the insect vectors.</s><s>As a consequence, control strategies should be targeted towards the key period of the vectors, considering not only their abundance, but also their vector competence and efficiency during the season, in relation to phytoplasma load.</s><s>It is therefore clear that great differences occur in different pathosystems.</s><s>Although the study of these parameters can be quite easy in the case of monophagous insects with a simple biological cycle, it can be more complicated in the case of oligophagous or polyphagous vectors with more complex biological cycles.</s><s>Such is the case for most of the psyllid vectors of phytoplasmas that spend a great part of the year on conifers as shelter plants for aestivation and overwintering, even kilometers away from apple orchards <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>For a long time, this particular biological cycle hampered the constant monitoring of these vectors and prevented the detailed analysis of phytoplasma load inside them throughout the year.</s><s>Although some attempts were made to reproduce the whole biological cycle in the laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, an accurate study of the phytoplasma multiplication in psyllids can be carried out only by isolating the vectors on the shelter plants in nature and testing them throughout the year, as was done by Thébaud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) (Homoptera: Psyllidae).</s><s>Phytoplasma multiplication during aestivation and overwintering on conifers is indeed a phenomenon regulated by complex interactions of biotic and abiotic factors, such as temperature, relative humidity and air pressure due to altitude, which cannot accurately be reproduced in the laboratory.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the vector competence and efficiency can be strongly influenced, even within the same species, by different associations of vector populations and phytoplasma strains occurring in different geographical areas, as highlighted for the psyllid Cacopsylla melanoneura Förster (Homoptera: Psyllidae), vector of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali', the causal agent of apple proliferation disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, there is a strict co-occurrence of AT-1-associated subtypes of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' and C. melanoneura in Northwest Italy, where C. melanoneura is considered to be the most important vector of this phytoplasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, whereas in other regions, where C. melanonera is considered an ineffective or a low efficient vector, 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' subtypes AT-2 <ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> are present.</s></p><p><s>Cacopsylla melanoneura starts to colonize apple trees at the end of January and reaches peak density around mid-March <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>At the end of May, the newly emerged adults rapidly move to conifers, which they use as shelter plants for aestivation and overwintering <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>To date, in the regions were C. melanoneura has a relevant role in the transmission of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali', transmission trials and molecular analyses carried out with specimens collected on apple plants have highlighted the crucial role of overwintered individuals in comparison to newly emerged adults due to a higher percentage of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali'-positive individuals (3.6% vs. 0.8%) and a longer period spent in apple orchards (14.6 vs. 6 weeks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>On the contrary, several doubts remain regarding the ability of nymphs and newly emerged adults to reach the latency period before migration to conifers, due to a lower efficiency in transmitting the phytoplasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The discovery, in recent years, of sites colonized by C. melanoneura during aestivation and overwintering in Northwest Italy, after the migration from apple orchards, has made it possible to follow the entire life cycle of the vector, opening up new perspectives on the study of phytoplasma vector relationships during the entire year and thus on the epidemiology of apple proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the present work was to investigate the temporal dynamics of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' load in the insect vector C. melanoneura in order to highlight the acquisition competence and the infective risk of the different developmental stages during the whole year in one region (Aosta Valley, Northwest Italy), in which the role of this vector in the spread of Apple proliferation phytoplasma (APP) has been proved to be crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The assessment of phytoplasma acquisition efficiency and accumulation in insect vectors, as well as the potential infectivity of the insects at different life stages, based on the pathogen load, is fundamental in order to better understand the epidemiology of the diseases and to optimize the control strategies against the vectors and, as a consequence, the spread of the diseases.</s><s>Two psyllid vectors of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' are acknowledged, but in Northwest Italy only C. melanoneura has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>In relation to its complex life cycle, the knowledge of the vector competence at the different life stages, and in specific moments within the period spent on apple trees allows us to define more sustainable well-timed control strategies targeted towards the most worrisome life stages.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies, based on molecular detection of the phytoplasma in the first overwintering adults collected in the apple orchards at the end of winter <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, already suggested the possibility that overwintering adults maintain the phytoplasma acquired in the previous season, whereas controlled transmission trials revealed that all stages are able to transmit the phytoplasma even with a very low percentage, in the case of nymphs and newly emerged adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, no data were available regarding the dynamics of phytoplasma load in the vectors throughout the year.</s><s>To our knowledge the present work is the first study that has analyzed the phytoplasma titer during the entire lifespan of C. melanoneura, producing useful results about the infective risk of the psyllid in different times of the year and confirming previous results on phytoplasma retention.</s></p><p><s>We started all the experiments with field-collected overwintered adults, being aware that these individuals might not be considered healthy even if sampled on asymptomatic plants.</s><s>The natural infection rate was found to be very low (1.67%) and thus the probability to handle 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' positive specimens was very low as well.</s><s>We also performed real-time qPCR on field-collected overwintered adults in order to compare their phytoplasma titers with the ones obtained after a controlled AAP, and eventually to highlight large differences ascribable to a natural infection.</s></p><p><s>Actually, in field-collected adults the phytoplasma titer was almost always 10 to 100 times higher than in the overwintered adults subjected to controlled acquisition trials, except for three individuals that were supposedly already infected before the AAP.</s><s>In all the other cases, our results suggest the possibility that remigrants may still be able to acquire the phytoplasma, even at a low rate and in an uneven pattern compared with the AAP timing.</s><s>Nil or one infected psyllids were recorded after 1, 2 or 20 days of AAP.</s><s>This may be due to the short AAP (1 day), to the insect phytoplasma load that could be below the real-time PCR detection limit or to a reduced acquisition and retention efficiency in older overwintered adults.</s></p><p><s>As shown by RT-qPCR, first and second instar nymphs acquired 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali', but at a very low percentage (7.14%)</s><s>and, at the same time, in low quantities compared to the further stages.</s><s>More concerning for their high phytoplasma content and infection rate are the 3 rd -5 th instar nymphs and the newly emerged individuals that spent a longer time on infected plants.</s><s>Our results confirmed the higher acquisition efficiency of immature stages, as already reported for several other phytoplasma vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, whereas a significantly lower phytoplasma titer was recorded both in nymphs (3 rd -5 th instar), and in newly emerged adults, compared with the naturally infected overwintered adults.</s><s>This may suggest, as already reported by Thébaud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, that a longer latency period is required for immature psyllids to become infectious compared to other insect vectors.</s></p><p><s>More evidence confirming this hypothesis comes from the results obtained during the aestivation and overwintering period on conifers.</s><s>Despite the reduction of the phytoplasma multiplication rate due to the decreasing of metabolic activity during the diapause, suggested by Oppedisano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, in our trials a constant increase of the 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' load was observed during the permanence on shelter plants.</s><s>In addition, we demonstrated that the infectivity persists in C. melanoneura from spring to the following winter without an intermediate reacquisition, as already observed for C. pruni, the vector of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum' <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>A slight decrease of the phytoplasma titer was initially observed just after the transfer of the newly emerged adults on conifers until a 15-day permanence on the shelter plants.</s><s>We suggest that this phytoplasma titer loss could be attributable to the excretion of phytoplasma cells, ingested by the psyllids after feeding on infected apple plants, but which has not yet passed through the midgut and basement membrane before the shift to P. abies, where minimum feeding activity is supposed to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>A general relevant increase of the phytoplasma titer occurs proportionally after at least 15 days, suggesting the beginning of pathogen multiplication in the vector body, whereas a sort of plateau seems to be reached after 60 days spent on conifers.</s></p><p><s>After more than 60 days of permanence on conifers, C. melanoneura adults reached a phytoplasma load much higher compared to the naturally infected overwintered specimens.</s><s>According to what was previously reported for Cicadellidae <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, it is possible to assume that insects with a phytoplasma load higher than 2.00 × 10 4 GU/ng insect 18S rDNA could be infective.</s><s>In our trials, this value occurred in all the psyllids after more than a 60-day stay on conifers, when phytoplasma titers ranged between 5.74 × 10 and 2.42 × 10 4 GU/pg insect 18S rDNA (corresponding to 5.74 × 10 4 and 2.42 × 10 7 GU/ng insect 18S rDNA, respectively).</s><s>However, some newly emerged adults reached this value in the first 60 days: 50%, 39%, 75%, 53% and 81% of the tested psyllids achieved a phytoplasma titer higher than 2.00 × 10 GU/pg insect 18S rDNA (corresponding to 2.00 × 10 4 GU/ng insect 18S rDNA) after 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 days spent on conifers, respectively.</s><s>According to these results, newly emerged adults may transmit 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' from a few days after emergence.</s><s>However, a few considerations need to be taken into account in this regard.</s></p><p><s>First, our experimental conditions slightly deviate from field conditions.</s><s>The psyllid used in our trials constantly fed on infected plants from egg hatching to the emergence of the adults (about 30 days).</s><s>The phytoplasma titer of test plants was certainly higher than the ones in the apple orchards, where trees could be healthy or larger in size.</s><s>These conditions could present a higher dilution and an uneven distribution of the phytoplasma in the phloem.</s><s>Only in the case in which eggs are laid on infected plants do nymphs constantly feed on infected plants, due to their low mobility until the adult phase, which increases the probability of transmission of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali'.</s><s>This situation is highly likely in orchards with a high infection rate.</s><s>Moreover, newly emerged adults tend to rapidly migrate to shelter plants, so their impact on the spread of the disease in the orchards can be worrisome when their permanence on apple trees is prolonged, for instance, due to cold springs or unfavourable conditions for migration.</s></p><p><s>After the AAP, the phytoplasma load of a few newly emerged individuals was even higher (six values out of 35), compared to the one recorded in naturally infected overwintered adults.</s><s>Even if the possibility of a transovarial transmission in C. melanoneura has never been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, this possibility should not be completely excluded, because it could explain these findings.</s></p><p><s>Our results differed from a previous Italian study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> in which a very low percentage of infected individuals were observed after a controlled acquisition trial and which also led to a lower transmission efficiency compared with the congeneric Cacopsylla picta Förster (Homoptera: Psyllidae).</s><s>The phytoplasma load seemed to be much lower, even if not easily comparable to our results.</s><s>These differences confirm the existence of variability in vector competence between populations of C. melanoneura from different geographic areas.</s><s>Differences in acquisition efficiency may be also be linked to the host plants and the pathogen strain AT-2 used in Oppedisano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The AT-2 strain of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali' is not as common in our region, and therefore we chose the AT-1 strain because it is representative of the typical pathogen encountered by C. melanoneura in apple orchards in Northwest Italy.</s></p><p><s>Although the trend of phytoplasma accumulation in the psyllids during aestivation and overwintering clearly demonstrates the achievement of a sort of saturation (after 90-150 days), this did not happen in all the individuals.</s><s>If we look at the single values, we can see that there are specimens with only a few hundred phytoplasma GU even after &gt; 250 days.</s><s>It is likely that the quantity of phytoplasmas acquired during the first stages has a role, and only when a relatively "high" phytoplasma titer has been acquired (a sort of threshold) can the saturation point be reached.</s><s>Alternatively, some unknown barriers may occur during the development.</s><s>Further research is needed to clarify these aspects.</s></p><p><s>In light of the results obtained in the present study, we can confirm that particular attention should be paid to the management of overwintered C. melanoneura feeding on apple trees as soon as they return to apple orchards at the end of the winter.</s><s>This is because they are the specimens with the higher phytoplasma load and thus the most hazardous stage for the spreading of the disease, promoting the long distance dissemination of the pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, based on the phytoplasma load of 3 rd -5 th nymphs and newly emerged adults, we have proved the infective risk of these stages, which could cause the spreading of the disease within orchards, but this is more likely to occur in special situations, such as in the case of transovarial transmission of the phytoplasma in C. melanoneura, in orchards with a high infection rate and when the migration to the conifers is delayed.</s></p><p><s>The open question of possible phytoplasma transovarial transmission in C. melanoneura requires further investigation, because it could explain some of the obtained results and eliminate some remaining doubts.</s><s>The vertical transfer of the phytoplasma to the progeny has been proved for the congeneric species C. pruni <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and C. picta <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and there is no reason to believe that this is not possible for C. melanoneura.</s><s>This is considering the fact that the phytoplasmas hosted and transmitted by the three psyllid species belong to the same taxonomic group.</s></p><p><s>The obtained results refer to a specific geographical area (Aosta Valley, Northwest Italy) where C. melanoneura has been proved to be the main vector of 'Ca.</s><s>P. mali', and are not necessarily transposable to other areas where even slight variations in climatic conditions, or different psyllid populations and phytoplasma strains could lead to different interplays between the pathogens and the insect vectors.</s></p></div>
