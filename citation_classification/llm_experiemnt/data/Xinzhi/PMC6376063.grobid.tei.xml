<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the current study, we evaluated first the use of orange jasmine as a trap crop in two types of orange orchards, recently planted and several years old, that differed in plant height and biomass (new orchard: 1 m-tall; well established orchard: 3 m-tall; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The presence of orange jasmine as a trap crop in the border of new citrus orchards caused overall reductions of 40% in the accumulated number of psyllids captured (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and 83% in the number of psyllids settled on citrus trees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), when compared to the fallow field plots  (control).</s><s>Moreover, in the control plot the frequency of D. citri detection was 1.6-fold higher than in the orange jasmine plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Similar insect reduction rates associated to the trap crop use were obtained after planting green leaf desmodium [Desmodium intortum (Mill.)</s><s>Urb.] and Brachiaria cv.</s><s>Mulato II as 'push' and 'pull' crops, respectively, on maize (Zea mays L.), in order to reduce the fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.</s><s>Smith)] (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) infestation and damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Likewise, Stern et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> demonstrated a reduction in the L. hesperus movement into cotton in California (USA), when alfalfa was intercropped with cotton.</s></p><p><s>Regarding D. citri spatial distribution, most psyllids were found in the first rows of citrus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) regardless of the treatment and assessment period, reinforcing psyllid preference for trees located in the border of the orchards <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Psyllids released in front of the trap crop plots did not disperse further than the first row of citrus, whereas individuals released in front of control plots were able to cross the first row and were present in almost all rows.</s><s>On the other hand, a high number of individuals were observed on orange jasmine trap crop during the first assessments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), including insects that were released on control plots.</s><s>These results may be explained by a strong attraction effect associated to the orange jasmine trees, which could have reduced psyllid movement into the orchard, and suggest that the psyllid has the ability to detect and move to the preferred host rather than performing a passive random dispersal.</s><s>This hypothesis is in accordance with previous studies that report the importance of visual and olfactory cues in the host plant finding ability of D. citri <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The low effect of orange jasmine trap crop on D. citri infestation when tested on well-established citrus orchards also supports the hypothesis of visual and olfactory cues for D. citri behavior.</s><s>Probably, large differences in plant size between orange jasmine and citrus trees on mature plots may lead to higher presence of visual/olfactory cues from citrus trees than from orange jasmine plants, thus explaining the absence of trap crop effect over the D. citri population in this case.</s><s>According to Shelton and Badenes-Perez <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , a successful trap crop relies on the combination of trap crop (e.g.</s><s>size, phenology, and attractiveness) and pest characteristics.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of orange jasmine olfactory cues as D. citri attractants, 4-arm olfactometric assays were performed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>An increase of ~30% in D. citri preference to orange jasmine volatiles in relation to that of 'Pera' sweet orange was observed.</s><s>High attractiveness of orange jasmine flushes to D. citri has been also observed in Y-olfactometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, our olfactometric data reinforces the D. citri preference to volatiles from orange jasmine instead of sweet orange flushes.</s><s>In this sense, the orange jasmine odors plume could contribute for psyllid mobility towards orange jasmine, which increases the D. citri settling preference to this host, as observed in field experiments.</s><s>Regarding the volatile analysis, we found that orange jasmine volatile profile is clearly distinguishable to that of sweet orange (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>Then, analyses were conducted to identify which compounds were relevant to make this distinction either quantitatively or qualitatively (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Green leaf volatiles, such as hexenyl acetates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , were more emitted by orange jasmine than by sweet orange leaves, as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Monoterpene emission was also different between genotypes, being all them less abundantly emitted by orange jasmine.</s><s>Lower emission of d-limonene and β-ocimene was also found in orange jasmine in relation to lemon (Citrus × limon (L.)
