<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Snf7 is present in most eukaryotic organisms.</s><s>There are three human Snf7 homologs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and two mouse Snf7 homologs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, of which, mSnf7-2 knockout mice died during embryogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Two Snf7 homologs have also been reported for C. elegans (CeVps32.1 &amp; CeVps32.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>RNAi or deletion of CeVps32.1 caused lethality at multiple developmental stages of C. elegens <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and feeding of bacteria expressing dsRNA of CeVps32.1 showed almost 100% mortality in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>These studies demonstrated that Snf7 is a vital gene involved in eukaryotic developmental processes and different isoforms may have specific functions.</s><s>However, a single Snf7 homolog (Shrub) was identified and characterized in Drosophila.</s><s>The shrub mutants embryos died before reaching the larval stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>We examined our WCR transcriptome/genomic database and found a single gene homologous to Snf7 (DvSnf7) (data not shown).</s><s>In addition, Southern blot analysis of WCR genomic DNA confirmed the existence of single copy of DvSnf7 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Feeding of DvSnf7 dsRNA to WCR larval stages results in stunting after five days of exposure followed shortly by lethality of larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>To investigate the mechanism of DvSnf7 RNAi leading to death, midgut (primary contact tissue with dsRNA via oral feeding) and fat bodies (primary metabolic tissue and nutrient sensor) tissues were analyzed after five days of exposure to DvSnf7 dsRNA.</s><s>Suppression of DvSnf7 mRNA levels was confirmed by real-time PCR in midgut and fat body tissues of larvae that were fed on DvSnf7 dsRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>DvSnf7 mRNA levels were downregulated by approximately 13-and 140-fold in fat bodies and midguts respectively, when compared to tissues from insects fed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA or in tissues of preexposed insects (controls).</s><s>These results indicate that the RNAi effect is systemic in WCR, which is consistent with previous data demonstrating the spread of RNAi beyond the midgut in WCR; suppression of DvSnf7 mRNA levels is observed in the carcass tissues by oral ingestion of DvSnf7 dsRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and by injection of DvvLaccase2 in WCR larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Due to multiple sources of data indicating the presence of systemic RNAi in WCR, we analyzed the cellular effects of DvSnf7 RNAi in both midgut and fat body tissues.</s></p><p><s>First, we mapped the endosomal protein sorting activity in the midguts and fat bodies of DvSnf7 and GFP dsRNA-fed larvae using an anti-ubiquitin antibody and immunohistochemistry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Normally, the protein cargoes destined for lysosomal degradation are sorted by the ESCRT pathway via ubiquitination.</s><s>Subsequent removal of ubiquitin from cargoes requires the enzymatic activity of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme Doa4 (degradation of alpha-2) and recruitment of Doa4 to the endosome requires correct assembly of ESCRT-III <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, prominent intracellular ubiquitin staining was observed in the midguts of DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed insects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; panel A').</s><s>The ubiquitin signals were visualized throughout the midgut and also in the adjoining malphigian tubules in the perinuclear regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; panel A'').</s><s>Ubiquitin puncta were distinct in the midgut epithelium in the DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed larvae at higher magnification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; panel A*).</s><s>In contrast, no ubiquitin signal was detected in the midgut of the GFP dsRNA-fed control larvae representing absence of accumulated ubiquitinated protein, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; panels B series).</s><s>Similarly, staining of fat bodies of DvSnf7 dsRNAfed larvae with anti-ubiquitin antibody revealed prominent patterns of evenly dispersed ubiquitin puncta (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, panel C').</s><s>Ubiquitin signals were significantly enhanced around the nuclei in the fat body cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">panel C''</ref>, <ref type="figure">C*</ref>).</s><s>These patterns were absent in fat body tissue of GFP dsRNA-fed larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, panel D'', D*).</s><s>No fluorescent signals or puncta were observed in the midguts and fat bodies of either DvSnf7 or GFP dsRNA-fed larvae in the absence of primary anti-ubiquitin antibody (negative control; data not shown).</s><s>These results indicate that DvSnf7 RNAi causes the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.</s></p><p><s>Loss of function of ESCRT-III subunits has been previously reported to cause accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in multiple organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, all ESCRT mutants, including vps32, displayed severe intracellular ubiquitin accumulation in the mosaic eye discs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Besides ESCRT proteins, suppression of Waharan, a protein that was shown to act upstream of ESCRT-III, Shrub in endosomal trafficking pathway, caused the appearance of prominent ubiquitinated puncta, reflecting the accumulation of proteins that fail to be stripped of their ubiquitin tags in the muscle tissue of Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In the same study, it was shown that ubiquitin accumulation was a common feature upon interference with endocytic trafficking, as it was visualized in mutants of endosomal markers (Rab5, Rab7) and Shrub (a dominant-negative form of Snf7).</s></p><p><s>In line with these observations, suppression of DvSnf7 in WCR larval tissues leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins indicating the requirement of this putative ESCRT-III component for protein sorting.</s><s>Studies have demonstrated that de-ubiquitination carried out by Doa4 is recruited by Bro1, which interacts with ESCRT-III component Vps32, thereby connecting Doa4 and the ESCRT pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, it appears that suppression of DvSnf7 in WCR interferes with the de-ubiquitination process, leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, impairment of protein sorting and degradation of proteins.</s></p><p><s>Second, we examined the autophagic response of WCR to DvSnf7 dsRNA treatments using the Lysotracker marker as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Autophagy is the process through which the cellular proteins and other cytoplasmic components are cleared through lysosomal degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The autophagic process can be stimulated in response to environmental signals such as nutritional deficit (starvation), which results in an autophagy-dependent expansion and acidification of the lysosomal compartments.</s><s>Rusten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> demonstrated that several components of ESCRT-I, -II, and -III are required for autophagy in Drosophila.</s><s>Insect fat bodies are specialized in mounting a particularly robust autophagic response to starvation, serving to provide a reserve source of nutrients for other critical tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, under starvation conditions, intense punctate staining indicative of acidic lysosome activity appeared in all cells of midgut and fat body tissues of dsGFP treated larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, C &amp;D).</s><s>However, starvation-induced formation of Lysotracker stainpositive structures was severely inhibited in both midguts and fat body tissues of DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, <ref type="figure">A</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Under normal dietary conditions, midguts and fat body tissues failed to incorporate Lysotracker and punctate fluorescent signals were observed in neither DvSnf7 nor GFP dsRNA-fed larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, <ref type="figure">E-H</ref>).</s><s>No fluorescent signals or puncta were observed in the midguts and fat body tissues of either DvSnf7 or GFP dsRNA starved or fed larvae that were incubated in dye solution free of Lysotracker (negative control; data not shown).</s><s>At higher magnification, Lysotracker puncta were observed mostly in the perinuclear region of the fat body and midgut cells of starved GFP RNAi insects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, A &amp;B).</s><s>No Lysotracker staining was observed in starved DvSnf7 RNAi tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, C&amp; D); or in the tissues of GFP and DvSnf7 dsRNA fed insects (data not shown).</s><s>The reduction of starvation-induced Lysotracker staining following suppression of DvSnf7 suggests that acidic lysosome activity is disrupted, with a possible effect on autophagy.</s><s>These data indicate that suppression of DvSnf7 disrupts starvation-induced autophagy in both midgut and fat bodies of WCR.</s></p><p><s>Since autophagy is a lysosomal-mediated process of cytoplasmic degradation and starvation induces autophagy, we were able to differentiate the effects of DvSnf7 RNAi in this stimulated condition but not under the normal dietary conditions using Lysotracker staining.</s><s>Similar observations have been made in Drosophila, where fat body tissue dissected from fed animals failed to incorporate Lysotracker (or occasionally displayed faint diffuse staining) while intense punctate Lysotracker staining was observed in the fat body of starved animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Our data indicating the inhibition of autophagic degradation in DvSnf7 dsRNA -fed larval tissues are in agreement with the study in Drosophila, where mutations in components of ESCRT-I (Vps25), -II (Vps28) or -III (Vps32) impacted starvation-induced Lysotracker staining in the larval fat body <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>Mutations in ESCRT-III subunits have also been implicated in the inhibition of autophagic degradation in mammalian systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, C. elegans yolk proteins tagged with GFP showed increased fluorescence in the ESCRT-III (Vps32.2) mutant embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>However, in another isoform mutant, Vps32.1, these bright irregular puncta were not observed and the embryos showed 100% lethality.</s><s>Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> predicted that these puncta in Vps32.2 represented overlapped vescicles containing yolk proteins that failed to be further degraded, presumably by a block in their fusion with lysosomes.</s><s>This study suggests the involvement of one of the isoforms of CeVps32 in endosomal to lysosomal protein degradation.</s></p><p><s>Malfunctioning of ESCRT-III specific functionalities such as de-ubiquitination and autophagy have been previously attributed to Snf7 depletion.</s><s>However, studies in Drosophila eye discs suggest that Vps32/Snf7 may also be required for endocytosis of receptors, which is the initial step of the ESCRT pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>These authors demonstrated that Vps32/Snf7 mutants displayed less endosomal accumulation of Notch and increased more plasma membrane localization than other ESCRT mutants.</s><s>Other components of ESCRT complexes and vacuolar sorting proteins (Vps34) have also been shown to be involved in the proper functioning of endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The endocytosis process involves internalization of extracellular materials and transmembrane proteins into the cell membrane for intracellular trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, we monitored the effects of DvSnf7 RNAi on the endocytotic ability of WCR larval tissues by using the fluorescent endocytic tracer Texas-Redconjugated Avidin (TR-Avidin).</s><s>TR-Avidin has been successfully used to study the endocytosis process in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Midguts and fat bodies isolated from larvae after five days of exposure to either DvSnf7 or GFP dsRNAs were subjected to a pulse-chase treatment with TR-Avidin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>TR-Avidin was efficiently internalized by the midgut epithelial cells as well as fat body tissues of both DvSnf7 and GFP dsRNA-fed larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, panels A-D series).</s><s>Cytoplasmic and some nuclear (co)-localization were observed in the midguts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>; panels A'' &amp; B'').</s><s>Distinct intracellular localization was observed in the fat body cells of both treatments with nuclear co-localization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>; panels C'' &amp; D'').</s><s>No fluorescent signals were observed when tissues were incubated in medium without TR-Avidin (negative control; data not shown).</s><s>These results indicate that Avidin can be internalized by the cells, even with reduced levels of DvSnf7, indicating that DvSnf7 RNAi in WCR does not impair endocytosis, in general.</s><s>Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> investigated the roles of C. elegans ESCRT components by monitoring endocytosis of a yolk protein fused to GFP in the oocytes of nematodes subjected to RNAi against each ESCRT component, including CeVps-32.2</s><s>(a Snf7 homolog).</s><s>The pseudocoelomic accumulation of GFP tagged yolk proteins was interpreted as inefficient endocytosis.</s><s>It was reported that suppression of some of the components of ESCRT-II (CeVps-25, CeVps-36) and ESCRT-III (CeVps-20, CeVps-24) hampered endocytosis but not CeVps32.2,</s><s>which is consistent with our findings.</s><s>Double RNAi treatments of CeVps-20, CeVps24, and CeVps-25 also showed increased accumulation of yolk proteins in the pseudocoelom of worms, indicating that CeESCRT-II and -III complexes may play roles in the uptake of yolk proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>However, accumulation of yolk proteins and MVB biogenesis were not compromised in Drosophila Vps32 mutant oocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Induction of apoptosis is one of the potential pathways that can lead to cell death and mortality.</s><s>To investigate whether this is a potential mechanism for apoptosis in the mortality of WCR larvae, TUNEL staining was performed in midgut and fat body tissues of larvae fed with DvSnf7 and GFP dsRNAs after 5 days of exposure.</s><s>TUNEL staining was negative in both midgut and fat body tissues of larvae fed with DvSnf7 dsRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>; panels A &amp; B).</s><s>Similarly, TUNEL staining was absent in the tissues of larvae fed with GFP dsRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>; panels C &amp; D).</s><s>A subset of the samples was treated with DNAse (positive control) and showed distinct TUNEL staining in the nuclei of both midguts and fat bodies of larvae fed with either DvSnf7 or GFP dsRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>; panels E, F, G, H).</s><s>The samples incubated with labeling solution lacking DNAse (negative control) did not show any TUNEL staining (data not shown).</s><s>These results indicate that apoptosis is not the mechanism causing cell death of WCR larvae fed with DvSnf7 dsRNA.</s><s>Similar results were observed in mouse cortical neurons infected with mSnf7-2 siRNA lentivirus.</s><s>TUNEL staining was absent in these neurons indicating that apoptosis was not involved in the cell death and neural cell loss caused by ESCRT-III dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>This data indicate that apoptosis is not the primary cause of larval cell death and that ESCRT-III related functionalities might be involved.</s></p><p><s>Based on the data collected by tracking the distinct steps of the endosomal-autophagy pathway at the cellular level in WCR larval tissues, we propose the following model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>): in the normal cell, the endosomal-autophagic pathway plays a role in cellular homeostasis by internalization, transport, sorting and degradation of receptor cargo proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Proteins that receive an ubiquitin tag are internalized into endocytic structures (1) which then fuse to the early endosome.</s><s>In the endosome membrane, the ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the ESCRT pathway (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III complexes).</s><s>The cargo proteins are de- ubiquitinated and the free ubiquitin is then recycled <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>The deubiquitinated proteins are sorted by budding off of endosome membrane leading to the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>MVBs are late endosomes that accumulate small vesicles internally containing cargo proteins.</s><s>Finally, late endosomes fuse with the lysosomes forming the autolysosomes where proteins are degraded.</s><s>Concomitantly, intracellular organelles and long-lived proteins (ubiquitin aggregates) also undergo autophagic degradation.</s><s>This process is amplified under starved conditions.</s><s>These organellar components are engulfed in a closed double layered vacuole termed autophagosomes (4).</s><s>The autophagosomes fuse either with the late endosomes or directly with the lysosomes forming autolysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, which leads to the final degradation of the incorporated materials.</s></p><p><s>In the DvSnf7 suppressed cells, endocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins appear to be functioning normally (as indicated by avidin incorporation in DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed insects in the present study).</s><s>The ubiquitinated proteins are then sorted by the ESCRT pathway, however the de-ubiquitination of these proteins is impaired due to insufficient DvSNF7 in the ESCRT-III complex.</s><s>The ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in the endosomal membrane (as evident in perinuclear localization of ubiquitin puncta in DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed larvae in the present study).</s><s>Failure of the ESCRT-III assembly disrupts MVB formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, as demonstrated by the absence of MVBs in mouse neurons treated with mSnf7-2 siRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and to a lesser extent of MVB biogenesis in Drosophila Vps32 mutant when compared to wild type <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Also, multiple lines of evidence suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in insect and mammalian cells as a result of Snf7 RNAi or Snf7 loss-of-function mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, as well as in other ESCRT subunit mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s>Autophagy might be impaired by the absence of autolysosomal activity (as demonstrated by the absence of Lysotracker staining in DvSnf7 dsRNA-fed larvae, even under stimulated conditions in the present study).</s><s>This might be due to a failure in the fusion of autophagosomes and endocytic vesicles to the lysosome compartments, as ESCRTs have been implicated in the fusion of autophagic vesicles and endocytic pathway for lysosomal degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Raiborg &amp;, Stenmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> inferred that ESCRT is involved in final closure of the autophagosome, which is essential for the fusion with lysosomes and control of the number of autophagosomes.</s><s>Hence, the apparent reduction in the Lysotracker staining in DvSnf7 RNAi insects could be an indirect effect as a result of failure of fusion of autophagosomes and endocytic vescicles to the lysosomes or final closure of the autopahgosome leading to impairment of autophagy.</s></p><p><s>In summary, suppression of DvSnf7 in WCR larvae leads to accumulation of the ubiquitinated proteins that are destined for lysosomal degradation.</s><s>The sorting of transmembrane receptors through the endosomal pathway is a critical feature of eukaryotic cell biology, in part because of its ability to regulate signal transduction.</s><s>Several cellular signaling pathways use ESCRT pathway for sorting and degradation of their membrane receptors such as Notch and epidermal growth factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, suppression of DvSnf7 in WCR larvae also may lead to impairment of autophagy.</s><s>Bulk degradation of damaged organelles and mis-folded cytoplasmic proteins by autophagy is also an important process for control of many physiological and pathological conditions in higher organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these data suggest that DvSnf7 is the single WCR functional homolog of yeast Snf7 and its suppression, via oral delivery of DvSnf7 dsRNA in WCR larvae, impairs cell homeostasis and functioning in multiple tissues leading to mortality of WCR larvae.</s></p></div>
