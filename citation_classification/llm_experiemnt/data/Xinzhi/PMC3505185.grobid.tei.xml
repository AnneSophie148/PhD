<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p><s>Degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides by P. cochleariae larval gut contents Enzymatic activities against carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), xylan and pectin have already been described for whole gut extracts from P. cochleariae larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, we decided to repeat these experiments using gut contents rather than whole gut homogenates.</s><s>In beetles, enzymes thought to be responsible for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides are likely to be secreted because of the presence of a predicted signal peptide at the amino-terminus of their respective amino acid sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, these proteins should be enriched in gut contents which, in insects, contain mainly digestive enzymes secreted by midgut cells in direct contact with the food bolus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, in diffusion assays, the gut contents from P. cochleariae larvae exert strong enzymatic activity against CMC, pectin and xylan, but no activity against galactomannan could be detected (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>These findings correlate well with what has been previously observed in this coleopteran species <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 1999, Girard &amp; Jouanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> demonstrated that P. cochleariae larval midgut homogenates were capable of degrading cellulose, pectin and xylan, and that transcripts encoding putative PCWDEs were actually present in a P. cochleariae gut cDNA library.</s><s>Nonetheless, these scientists did not show that the transcripts they sequenced from the cDNA library encoded the proteins responsible for the enzymatic activities they described.</s><s>To address this, we combined a proteomics approach to transcriptome sequencing to identify the proteins responsible for these enzymatic activities.</s><s>Initially, we separated gut content proteins by anion exchange chromatography similar to our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, considering this step as the 'first dimension' of a twodimensional approach.</s><s>A large portion of these proteins bound to the column and were eluted with NaCl concentration ranging from 40 to 440 mM.</s><s>After resolving these fractions by 1D/SDS-PAGE, which corresponds to the 'second dimension' of our two-dimensional approach, we used Coomassie blue staining to reveal a relatively simple pattern of distinct protein bands (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>Each fraction was tested for enzymatic activity towards CMC, xylan, pectin and mannan by two independent methods: (i) diffusion assays on agarose plates and (ii) zymograms using SDS-PAGE in 'semi native' conditions.</s><s>CMCase activity was very intense according to both diffusion assay and zymogram (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2A</ref>) and was detected in the same fractions with both techniques (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Guided by the pattern obtained using zymogram (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2A</ref>), we decided to pick protein bands number 8, 9, 10 and 11.</s><s>Strong xylanase activity could be detected only in fractions from the flowthrough (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>); no clear activity pattern could be obtained by zymogram (data not shown).</s><s>Similarly, pectinase activity was detected in the flowthrough by diffusion assay but not by zymogram.</s><s>We decided therefore to pick all visible protein bands from the flowthrough fraction with an apparent molecular weight above 20 kDa for tentative identification by mass spectrometry (protein bands 1 to 6).</s><s>Pectinase activity was also detected in bound fractions from the anion exchange chromatography both by diffusion assay and by zymogram (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2B</ref>), which led us to pick protein band 7. The activity patterns we obtained by zymogram using CMC and pectin as substrates are very similar to those obtained by Girard &amp; Jouanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Altogether 11 protein bands were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry for tentative identification.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein identification strategy</head><p><s>We decided to perform and compare two independent mass spectrometry analyses: (i) a 'classical' LC-MS/MS data-dependent acquisition method (DDA), and (ii) a relatively recent LC-MS E data-independent acquisition method (DIA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, the second method has been shown to improve protein and proteome coverage compared to the conventional LC-MS/MS approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In general, protein identifications obtained by both methods were in accordance, with the better coverage generally observed with LC-MS E compared to LC-MS/ MS (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Identifications were only obtained either by LC-MS/MS in four cases or by LC-MS E in five cases (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition, data obtained from Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> Gut contents of P. cochleariae larvae degrade several plant cell wall polysaccharides.</s><s>Gut contents (GC) prepared from third-instar P. cochleariae larvae were tested for activity against carboxymethylcellulose, pectin from citrus peels, beechwood xylan and galactomannan by agarose plate diffusion assays.</s><s>Five and 10 μl GC were deposited for each substrate as well as buffer only as control.</s><s>After incubation for 1 h at 30°C, enzymatic activities (clearing zones on a dark background) were revealed by staining either with Congo Red or with Ruthenium red (pectin).</s></p><p><s>the LC-MS/MS analyses were searched against various databases using Mascot and were alternatively interpreted de novo and searched against the same databases using MS BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>We performed the MS BLAST searches to confirm and increase the confidence of the Mascot searches.</s><s>We found that all MS BLAST searches were in accordance to the identifications obtained using Mascot except in the case of protein band 11 for which we found substantial differences between both search methods (see below).</s><s>Altogether, this strategy resulted in highly confident protein identifications with a very limited rate of false positives.</s><s>Detailed information regarding protein identifications is given as supplementary information (Additional file 2).</s></p></div>
