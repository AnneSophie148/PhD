Finally, us</s><s>ng infrared imagery an increase of 1.2 °C in plant canopy temperature was measured for peppers grown under eCO 2 .</s><s>Cotton and wheat also show an increase ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 °C, and closure of leaf stomata appears to be the main driver behind this response <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Increased plant canopy temperature can further modify the microclimate for the aphid and higher temperature has been shown to increase virus titer in wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this study, EPG recordings showed decreased aphid salivation into sieve elements and shorter non-probe phase under rising CO 2 , similar to the effects found for A. pisum <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>However, no differences were found for the duration and number of events of phloem ingestion, suggesting that eCO 2 was not a factor impeding sap feeding by M. persicae, as opposed to A. pisum <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>This result may also indicate that the diminished fitness observed could be mostly due to poorer tissue quality.</s><s>What analysed parameters seem to stress is that there were no differences in feeding behaviour explaining a worse performance in eCO 2 plants.</s><s>That is, aphids did not reduce or increase feeding, but simply ingested sap that was less nutritious.</s><s>Therefore, with equal ingested sap, aphids grew slower under eCO 2 because they acquired a much more unfavourable N content diet.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the number of single E1 waveforms (phloem salivation) not followed by E2 events (phloem ingestion) and the percentage of time spent on E1 were lower under eCO 2 .</s><s>Altogether, these results might imply that the ingestion success rate once aphids reached the phloem was higher under eCO 2 .</s><s>An explanation could be found in the natural defense responses triggered under herbivory pressure, resulting in a rejection of sustained feeding under ambient conditions.</s><s>Indeed, eCO 2 is likely to reduce the resistance ability of hosts against aphids by the down-regulation of genes involved in plant defence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>Without these barriers, aphids might be able to ingest phloem more easily under eCO 2 .</s><s>Several mechanisms have been proposed, and include but are not limited to: 1) decreased activity of enzymes mediating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, 2) reduced polymerization of phenolics absorbed by aphids that causes browning of cells in contact with the saliva, a disadvantage for aphid feeding, 3) down-regulation of ethylene signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , and 4) decreased jasmonic and salicylic acid defences <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Plants used for EPG recordings were grown inside CO 2 chambers for four weeks, whereas those used for the life history experiment were exposed to CO 2 during the aphid cycle as well, reaching a total of seven weeks, so it is likely that the nutritional profile of these plants declined with time.</s><s>Additional work testing different periods of CO 2 exposure should be addressed to evaluate if aphid response changes with time.</s></p><p><s>Work on the interactions between pepper plants and aphids was complemented with the study of CMV transmission by M. persicae when source and receptor plants were either previously exposed to ambient and elevated CO 2 before aphid introduction (indirect effect) or straight after insect inoculation (direct effect).</s><s>Elevated CO 2 lessened virus transmission risk if receptor plants had been previously grown under eCO 2 , but not if CO 2 was applied directly after pest introduction, which suggests that this difference may be associated with early exposure to elevated CO 2 .</s><s>CMV is transmitted in a non-circulative manner during brief probes in the host epidermis <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref>  the decrease in CMV transmission might be due to plant resistance mechanisms once the virus infected the host, rather than an altered aphid feeding behaviour during the stages involved in virus inoculation.</s><s>Under ambient CO 2 conditions, it has been shown that plant pathogens are responsible for triggering changes in nutritional quality or mediating attractiveness to increase the chances of vectors spreading viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>In our experiments, the decreased CMV transmission found under eCO 2 may be associated with lower aphid attraction to virus-infected plants, resulting in fewer viruliferous aphids, which would ultimately reduce the spread of CMV under future climate conditions.</s></p><p><s>Consecutive rising of CO 2 concentration and global temperature are a reality of future scenarios.</s><s>If disease severity changes under forthcoming environmental conditions, then additional research becomes imperative to understand the impact of viral infections on crop production and to minimise losses due to vector infestation.</s><s>Additional studies could add to knowledge on insect-plant interactions under elevated CO 2 .</s><s>Further studies with other insect vectors and beneficials are required to identify if the causal factors for the observed changes are conserved among different insect guilds.</s><s>With regard to subsequent virus transmission by vectors, studying the causes of a delay in symptom expression after CMV infection and the decrease in CMV transmission under indirect eCO 2 conditions may benefit the overall knowledge on the interactions among pathogens, host plants and vectors and help predict potential outbreaks.</s></p></div>
