<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In recent years, RNA interference (RNAi) has shown great potential to become a powerful tool in pest management.</s><s>RNAi is effective in many economically important insects, including honey bee, aphid, termite, mosquito, western corn rootworm, and Colorado potato beetle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr"

more practical.</s><s>Inducing mortality through RNAi has several advantages over conventional chemical pesticides.</s><s>As a consequence of its sequence-dependent mode of action, RNAi can be tailored to target only pest species and spare beneficial insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>This is accomplished by choosing to target unique mRNA sequences within the pest species.</s><s>Likewise, RNAi pesticides can be designed to target a broad range of insects by choosing sequences that are more conserved between species.</s><s>Another advantage of RNAi pesticides is that the "active ingredient" is RNA, which is organic, biodegradable, and can be inexpensively produced within microorganisms.</s></p><p><s>RNAi is a cellular mechanism that likely evolved to protect eukaryotes from RNA viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>To activate the RNAi pathway, double stranded RNA (dsRNA) can be fed to insects and absorbed into the cells that line the midgut.</s><s>Exogenous dsRNA is usually processed into 20-30 nucleotide duplexes by the ribonuclease III enzyme DICER <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</s><s>These nucleotide duplexes are assembled onto the catalytic component ARGONAUTE and a single guide strand is incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>The guide strand binds to complementary mRNAs, and the RISC complex mediates degradation or translational suppression of the endogenous transcript.</s><s>The RISC complex will cleave the mRNA when base pair matching is highly complementary, or alternatively, the complex can bind the mRNA and suppress translation when there are mismatched base pairs.</s><s>Degradation or suppression of transcripts that code for critical genes in the insect results in decreased amounts of critical gene products and increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Some species, such as C. elegans, possess a SID-1 RNA channel transporter that facilitates uptake of dsRNA into cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Dipterans do not posses a SID1 ortholog, but are able to absorb dsRNA through other mechanisms, such as receptor mediated endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Studies have shown dsRNA can enter Drosophila melanogaster cells through injection into whole animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> or through addition to the growth medium of cultured cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Whyard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> demonstrated that Drosophilids are able to uptake dsRNA from oral ingestion of dsRNA solution containing a lipid encapsulating reagent, resulting in tissue-specific gene suppression and mortality.</s><s>Importantly, this study supports the idea that a Drosophilid pest could be controlled through oral delivery of dsRNA.</s></p><p><s>Delivery of intact dsRNA into insect cells remains a challenge, although many delivery methods have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Crops can be genetically engineered to express dsRNA targeting insect pests <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>The use of modified plants has proven remarkably effective in managing coleopteran pests such as western corn rootworm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Another delivery method is to synthesize the dsRNA in vitro, and then apply to foliage by spraying <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , or to roots by soaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , resulting in a transient presence of dsRNA within the plant tissue.</s><s>Nanoparticles composed of chitosan and dsRNA have been used to deliver dsRNA to larval mosquitos through oral ingestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> demonstrated that bacteria expressing dsRNA can be fed to insects to induce RNAi <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and genetically modified bacteria can even colonize the gut and deliver dsRNA from within the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study is to demonstrate that genetically modified yeast can be used to produce and deliver dsRNA to Drosophila, resulting in altered gene expression and decreased fitness in the fly.</s><s>We chose to use yeast as a delivery vehicle for dsRNA because of the symbiosis between yeast, Drosophila, and fruits.</s><s>Yeast is an important endosymbiont and a major component of the microbiome in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Yeasts are naturally found growing on the surface of intact and rotting fruits and produce volatiles that are highly attractive to Drosophilids <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Palanca et al. quantified the attractive properties of wild yeast isolates and found fruit-associated isolates were more attractive than those not associated with fruit, regardless of taxonomic positioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, they found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the most attractive to Drosophila melanogaster.</s><s>We therefore selected to modify S. cerevisiae for this study.</s><s>S. cerevisiae lacks a functional RNAi mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , which might make it a suitable dsRNA delivery vehicle if the absence of RNAi

sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , where they can be ingested by larvae or adults.</s><s>Thus, yeast is a chemoattractive, transmittable symbiont of Drosophila and fruit crops.</s><s>We

target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>We chose to target D. suzukii in this study because it is a serious economic pest and is sufficiently homologous to the model insect D. melanogaster to facilitate target gene selection.</s><s>Our laboratory has recently sequenced the D. suzukii genome, which further aids in the design of dsRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, yeast-baited traps have been demonstrated to effectively lure D. suzukii in an agricultural setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , and evidence suggests that D. suzukii feed on yeasts in the field <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effects of yeast feeding treatment on adult locomotor activity levels are species specific.</head><p><s>One benefit of using RNAi in pest management is that RNAi triggers can be designed to target pest species while minimizing the risk of effects on beneficial insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>To demonstrate this, we tested a D. suzukii dsRNA fragment selected from the non-conserved yTub23C 3' untranslated region (UTR).</s><s>We fed transformed yeast expressing dsRNA targeting D. suzukii yTub23C to other Drosophilids and found that even closely related species were unaffected by the treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>D. biarmipes is closely related to D. suzukii, while D. melanogaster and D. simulans are more distant relatives (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>D. simulans, D. biarmipes, and D. melanogaster were unaffected by treatment with yeast expressing dsRNA targeting D. suzukii yTub23C.</s><s>All species maintained regular temporal patterns of activity throughout the day (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Homologous gene fragments were identified for each species by BLAST sequence alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , and sequence identity scores were calculated (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>The yTub23C target gene fragment was designed to be divergent by targeting the 3' UTR and is 90% to 74% conserved between D. suzukii and the other Drosophilids tested.</s><s>We predicted the yTub23C fragment would be less effective  on species other than D. suzukii due to reduced base pair matching.</s><s>The lack of an effect on activity in species other than D. suzukii suggests that a high degree of perfect base pair matching is required for RNAi response and to reduce locomotor activity.</s><s>These results imply the mechanism responsible for this reduction in locomotor activity level is target sequence dependent.</s><s>An alternative explanation for the differences in activity level between species following treatment could be that the dosage, i.e. feeding rate, varies by species, since the feeding assay was conducted ad libitum.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ingestion of yeast biopesticide alters expression level of target genes with subgroup specificity.</head><p><s>RNAi is not systemic in Drosophila, meaning RNAi only occurs within cells that come into contact with dsRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>We examined the midgut tissues post-treatment to measure changes in target gene expression in adults and larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>D. suzukii larvae fed on yeast expressing dsRNA targeting yTub23C for 72 hours had significantly reduced yTub23C mRNA levels in the midgut (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Adult D. suzukii midgut gene expression following yeast treatment was similar to the results in larvae, i.e. yTub23C expression level was significantly decreased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>We did not find significant changes in target gene expression in D. melanogaster larva or adult midguts following 72-hour feeding treatments with yeast expressing dsRNA targeting D. suzukii yTub23C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>The lack of change in target gene expression in D. melanogaster was not surprising, since we also observed no changes in locomotor activity.</s><s>Moreover, larvae were subjected to a no-choice feeding assay, so differences in gene expression between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster larvae are not expected to depend on dosage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ingestion of yeast biopesticide reduces reproductive fitness.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here we show that genetically modified yeast can be used to deliver dsRNA to an insect pest, causing decreased fitness through RNAi.</s><s>Ingestion of this modified yeast by adult D. suzukii results in decreased locomotor activity and reduced egg-laying.</s><s>Larvae exhibit reduced survival to adulthood when fed on yeast expressing dsRNA, and adults and larvae have decreased target gene expression following yeast feeding treatment.</s><s>We find the effects of the yeast feeding treatment on target gene expression, survival, and reproductive fitness are subgroup specific, i.e.</s><s>D. suzukii is negatively impacted while D. melanogaster is not.</s><s>It should be noted that we did not perform experiments to confirm that dsRNA produced by the yeast was present within the insect cells following ingestion of the yeast.</s><s>We found there was no feasible assay to separate the contents of the gut from the midgut cells and accurately detect exogenous transcripts coding for D. suzukii genes within D. suzukii cells.</s><s>Additionally, it should be noted that the control yeast strain contains only empty plasmid and does not produce any dsRNA.</s><s>Therefore, differences between the control and dsRNA treated samples may not be exclusively due to the effects of RNAi alone.</s><s>It is possible that the dsRNA decreases fitness by inducing a sequence-independent response such as activation of the immune system, a phenomenon that has been observed in mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>However, since species with divergent target gene sequences, such as D. simulans, were unaffected by the yeast feeding treatment, we find it unlikely that sequence-independent effects were responsible for the observed decreases in fitness.</s><s>Changes in target gene expression following yeast-feeding treatment were observed in D. suzukii but not in D. melanogaster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>D. biarmipes, D. melanogaster, and D. simulans exhibited no changes in locomotor activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results suggest that sequence-dependent target gene knockdown via RNAi was the primary cause of decreased fitness observed in D. suzukii.</s></p><p><s>This yeast biopesticide could be improved as a delivery vehicle by additional modifications to the yeast genome.</s><s>A potential improvement to the current design could be to create modifications such that dsRNA is excreted from the yeast cells in membrane-bound vesicles.</s><s>In the current design, dsRNA is expressed from circular DNA plasmids and remains within the cell.</s><s>We hypothesize that dsRNA is absorbed into insect cells only when yeast cells are lysed within the insect midgut.</s><s>It has been previously demonstrated that lipid encapsulated siRNA is more stable and more readily absorbed than naked siRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we predict continuous excretion of dsRNA in membrane bound-vesicles from intact yeast could increase the dosage and absorption of dsRNA into insect midgut cells.</s></p><p><s>The biosafety of this yeast biopesticide could be increased by adding a built-in mechanism of containment.</s><s>A common concern with genetically modified organisms is their containment and potential negative impact on the environment.</s><s>Yeast can be carried from one location to another by Drosophila, so it seems likely that genetically modified yeast could be spread beyond the boundaries of agriculture.</s><s>Our design could be improved simply by placing the dsRNA under a promoter that requires the presence of an artificial molecule in order to prevent expression of dsRNA in the yeast where it is not wanted <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Recently, bacteria known as synthetic auxotrophs were engineered to only be viable in the presence of the synthetic molecule benzothiazole <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , which prevents genetically modified bacteria from escaping and increases biosafety.</s><s>However, benzothiazole is toxic and may pose additional problems for human safety.</s><s>Another genetic modification technique has been used to create bacterial strains that require synthetic amino acids for growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , which may be more suitable for environmental use.</s><s>This technology could be applied to yeast biopesticides to prevent unwanted escapes.</s></p><p><s>We predict that this yeast biopesticide could be successfully implemented in the field to combat D. suzukii.</s><s>The emergence of insecticide resistance and increasing popularity of organic food products may open the door to non-chemical means of pest control in both organic and conventional farming.</s><s>A method for administering this yeast biopesticide in the field has already been presented, since yeast baited traps have previously been used in berry crops to lure D. suzukii <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, there is precedence for the agricultural use of genetically modified fungi, as the USDA has issued 26 permits for environmental release of genetically modified fungi since 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>A major limitation of the current design is that mortality is not induced in adults.</s><s>However, we found that this yeast biopesticide significantly decreases egg-laying and therefore could decrease the population size of the next generation.</s><s>This yeast biopesticide could be used in complement with chemical pesticides by targeting detoxification genes rather than critical genes, a strategy that has proven effective for increasing susceptibility of mosquito larvae to insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>By altering expression of detoxification genes, D. suzukii could be made more susceptible to chemical pesticides.</s><s>As different types of insecticide resistance emerge, the genes targeted by the yeast could easily and quickly be changed to compensate.</s><s>Further screening and validation is required to identify target genes that will have the greatest efficacy and produce high level of lethality when knocked down in the field.</s><s>Targeting multiple genes simultaneously may also increase toxicity of this biopesticide, although a recent study conducted in Tribolium castaneum found that the effects of targeting multiple genes are not synergistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Another characteristic of yeast that makes it an interesting candidate for a biopesticide is that unlike chemical pesticides, it can be easily grown with commonplace starting materials.</s><s>Currently, live S. cerevisiae, commonly known as brewer's yeast, can be purchased in packets from any grocery store.</s><s>The yeast in these packets is dry and does not require refrigeration.</s><s>We envision that in the future, a yeast biopesticide could be similarly packaged and distributed to farmers in developing countries, where it could be cultured at the site of use.</s></p><p><s>This yeast biopesticide design could be adapted to deliver dsRNA to other insect pests that associate with yeast.</s><s>Many interactions have been observed between wild yeasts and insect species within Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>In fact, this biopesticide design may have greater use in managing an insect pest that both consumes yeast and has systemic RNAi.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of all RNAi-based technology is potential off-target effects.</s><s>Only partial complementarity between the guide strand and the endogenous mRNA is required to prevent translation, so silencing of related transcripts in humans and other non-target species is a concern.</s><s>Non-target arthropod species that have systemic RNAi mechanisms may especially be at risk, and many of these species do not have genomic data available to facilitate the design of pest-specific dsRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>In addition to sequence-dependent off-target effects, introduction of dsRNA into mammalian cells can have sequence-independent effects on the immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>For example, dsRNA can activate an innate immune response in mammals, resulting in increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interferons <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>In this pathway, dsRNA binds and activates protein kinase R, which phosphorylates and deactivates eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2, thereby inhibiting translation in cells that contain dsRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>Since these effects on the immune system are not dependent on the sequence of the dsRNA, even careful selection of target sequences cannot mitigate these off-target effects.</s><s>Pesticides containing dsRNA will need further testing to determine safety for non-target arthropods and for human consumption.</s></p></div>
