Glycogen is a branched glucose polymer that stores energy and carbon in organisms, which plays an essential role in maintaining glucose and energy homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The glycogen in animals is synthesized under the catalysis of glycogen synthase, and glycogen degradation requires the action of glycogen phosphorylase, debranching enzymes and acid α-glucosidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>However, in insects, glycogen is primarily synthesized from UDP-glucose and is used as spare sugar along with trehalose in order to maintain glucose availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, glycogen metabolism in insects is closely related to the formation and utilization of trehalose.</s><s>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that acts as an important regulator of metabolism and development in diverse organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Numerous studies have confirmed that GSK3 plays an essential role in regulating glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>However, the molecular mechanisms by which GSK3 regulates chitin and fatty acid metabolism in D. <ref type="bibr">citri</ref> have not yet been reported.</s></p><p><s>RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in most organisms causing a sequence-specific gene silencing phenomenon induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>RNAi has recently been developed as a useful tool for functional gene research in animals and plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The silencing of some target genes in insects by ingesting dsRNA suggests that RNAi technology may have application in pest control.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Mao et al.</ref> revealed that silencing the Helicoverpa armigera P450 monooxygenase gene by plant-mediated RNAi impaired the larval tolerance of gossypol <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, RNAi has shown tremendous potential in pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>There are three approaches to deliver dsRNA to insects, including oral feeding, microinjection and topical applications, but the microinjection of dsRNA can only be used for fundamental research in the laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the transgenic plants expressing the dsRNA of specific genes are also receiving increasing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>However, RNAi efficiency is influenced by several external factors, including incomplete dsRNA internalization, instability of dsRNA, impaired systemic spreading of the RNAi signal and refractory target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, an efficient dsRNA delivery method and the selection of target genes are the two prerequisites for RNAi-mediated pest management.</s><s>RNAi by the oral delivery of dsRNA in insects has great potential as a tool for integrated pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Cao et al. demonstrated that silencing Mythimna separate chitinase genes by an oral delivery of dsRNA caused lethal phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The silencing of D. citri NADPHcytochrome P450 reductase (DcCPR) by oral delivery significantly decreased the expression level of DcCPR and increased the susceptibility of D. citri to chemical insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the silencing of the D. citri trehalase (DcTre) gene by RNAi significantly reduced the expression levels of chitin-metabolism-related genes, led to a malformed phenotype and dsRNA delivery was conducted by an artificial diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In hemipterans, dsRNA is easily degraded by either the high pH or dsRNase in the gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, we conclude that the microinjection of dsRNA is more than that of oral administration.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) gene, named DcGSK3, was identified from the D. citri genome database, and the sequences and spatial and temporal expression profiles of DcGSK3 were analyzed.</s><s>The functions of DcGSK3 were investigated using RNAi combined with transcriptome sequencing.</s><s>Furthermore, the levels of glucose, trehalose, glycogen, free fatty acids and trehalase activity were measured.</s><s>The results showed that the silencing of the DcGSK3 gene significantly inhibited chitin and fatty acid metabolism, indicating that DcGSK3 is involved in regulating chitin and fatty acid synthesis.</s><s>These findings provide a theoretical basis for D. citri control through chitin and fatty acid metabolism.</s></p></div>
