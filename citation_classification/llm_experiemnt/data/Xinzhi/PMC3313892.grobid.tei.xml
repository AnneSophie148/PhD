<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Localization of regulated transcripts in sexual and asexual ovaries</head><p><s>We compared the localization of these differentiallyexpressed transcripts in the ovaries of untreated asexual and sexual aphids using whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH), a technique that is not suitable for transcript quantification.</s><s>Specific antisense riboprobes were produced for 25 transcripts: five produced no signal (Additional file 1), four showed ubiquitous distribution (Additional file 2) and 16 transcripts were specifically expressed in germaria (containing germ and nurse cells) and/or in oocytes.</s><s>These results on untreated aphids were consistent with the microarray data from acetoneor kinoprene-treated aphids: most of the candidate genes are expressed in the ovarioles.</s><s>These 16 transcripts were grouped based on their patterns of expression in the two types of ovaries.</s></p><p><s>The first group included nine transcripts (bicC, histoneH1, gle1, gld2, pop2, arl6ip1, ACYPI007465, ACYPI010052 and ACYPI25088) that showed the same localization in sexual and asexual ovaries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) despite microarray results that indicated higher levels of expression in asexual embryos.</s><s>For five transcripts (gle1, bicC, ACYPI25088, ACYPI007465 and ACYPI010052), residual signals were observed in the developing embryo germ band (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The second group included two transcripts (uhrf1 and orb) that exhibited different localizations in the two types of ovaries.</s><s>Uhrf1 signal was detected in germaria and oocytes in asexual ovaries, and a weak signal was detected in sexual oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>orb was detected in oocytes prior to ovulation (stage 0), in asexual germaria, and in unknown cellular structures located at the junction between sexual germaria and oocytes.</s><s>Fluorescent detection of orb riboprobes was used together with fluorescent staining of actin filaments and DNA in order to define the intracellular localization of orb transcripts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>In asexual ovaries, orb signals could be seen during early oogenesis, in stage 0 (oocyte formation) and in stage 1 (separation of the oocyte from the germarium) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>).</s><s>In sexual ovaries, the transcripts were detected only before ovulation at the junctions between the sexual germaria and the oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>).</s><s>According to actin staining, a group of cells is localized at the junctions between sexual germaria and oocytes, these cells may correspond to the presumptive oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in asexual germaria, orb transcripts were detected in oocytes but not in presumptive oocytes;

males appeared the fourth day.</s><s>Sexuparae treated with kinoprene produced exclusively parthenogenetic progeny the first day after the onset of larviposition.</s><s>On day two, almost all the progeny were parthenogenetic.</s><s>On day three, the majority of the progeny were still parthenogenetic.</s><s>On days four and five, sexual morphs represented the majority of the progeny.</s></p><p><s>specific signal in the germaria and oocytes of sexual ovaries.</s><s>In contrast, a specific signal for lodestar, cyclin J, ACYPI39770 and ACYPI54656 was detected only in asexual ovaries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>lodestar transcripts were restricted to the diploid oocyte after separation from the germarium (stage 1).</s><s>cyclin J, ACYPI39770 and ACYPI54656 transcripts were detected in asexual germaria and oocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>In addition, ACYPI54656 and ACYPI39770 exhibited a residual signal in the germ bands of developing embryos (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>By coupling quantitative transcriptomic and qualitative WISH approaches, we identified 33 transcripts associated with the onset of divergent transcripts expression leading to the establishment of the sexual or asexual phenotype in aphids.</s><s>The involvement of these candidate genes in determining the developmental direction of oogenesis is supported by: i) a strong signature of oogenesis among the regulated transcripts (7/33); and ii) the oocyte-and/or germarial-specific localizations of 16 of the transcripts.</s><s>These data illustrate both shared and unique regulatory patterns of transcript expression for the two modes of reproduction.</s><s>First, we identified transcript expression profiles shared by sexual and asexual oogenesis.</s><s>These transcripts are expressed in sexual and asexual germaria and/or oocytes but display differences in their expression levels and/or in their localization.</s><s>In various organisms, gld2, bicC, pop2 and orb are all involved in regulating the poly(A) tail length of maternal mRNAs.</s><s>This process is a common mechanism of translational control essential for progression of meiosis and axis patterning during oocyte maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The regulation of poly(A) tail length of maternal mRNAs results from a balance between concomitant deadenylation (translation repression) and polyadenylation (translation activation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila melanogaster, gld2, bicC and orb have been described as part of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex that polyadenylates mRNAs and activates their translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Gld2-dependent mRNA polyadenylation and translational activation have been shown to be essential for oogenic meiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, mRNA deadenylation by the major deadenylation complex in Drosophila, CCR4-NOT, which includes the deadenylases CCR4, POP2, and four NOT proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, promotes negative regulation of target mRNAs.</s><s>Deadenylation of specific maternal mRNAs could be involved in the precise temporal and spatial mRNA localization necessary for axial patterning during oogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Expression of Api-gld2, Api-bicC, Api-pop2 and Api-orb in sexual and asexual germaria and/or in oocytes suggests that the balance between cytoplasmic polyadenylation and deadenylation in oocytes acts in the maturation of haploid as well as diploid oocytes in the pea aphid as it has been shown for other sexual organisms.</s><s>Moreover, expression of the oocyte-specific linkers histoneH1 and uhrf1 in asexual and sexual oocytes suggests that epigenetic regulation is involved in pea aphid oogenesis.</s><s>The linker histone H1 interacts with DNA to set-up and maintain the organization of the chromatin between the nucleosomes.</s><s>Histone H1 proteins form a complex family of related proteins that have distinct species, tissue and developmental specificities and are involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression.</s><s>The replacement of a somatic linker H1 by an oocyte specific one (H1oo) during oogenesis has been described in a wide range of species (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>) and may promote a loosening in chromatin structure that appears to correlate with the initiation of meiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of Api-histoneH1 in germaria and oocytes suggests that this oocyte-specific variant of H1 might be involved in both sexual and asexual oogenesis in aphid.</s><s>uhrf1 encodes an ubiquitin-like protein that is involved in two epigenetic silencing pathways through its regulation of DNA and histone methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Although, uhrf1 has not been implicated in any oogenesis process to date, our results suggest a role for this protein in asexual and sexual oogenesis in aphids.</s><s>Altogether, our results suggest that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and the balance between cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation and deadenylation may have roles in regulating haploid and diploid oocyte maturation.</s><s>Moreover, as orb transcript is the earliest to be differentially expressed during the developmental time course, we propose that Orb might play a major role in determining oocyte fate.</s></p><p><s>Second, we identified one gene, lsd1, that is specifically expressed in pea aphid sexual germaria and oocytes.</s><s>The lsd1 transcript was not significantly detected either in asexual embryos according to microarray data (Additional file 3) or in asexual ovaries according to WISH.</s><s>lsd1 encodes a protein involved in the regulation of lipid droplet storage in eukaryotic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Lipid droplets, like mature yolk bodies, are the major energy storage for oocytes and developing embryos in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Our results suggest that lsd1 is required only for sexual oogenesis during which it may be involved in yolk accumulation.</s><s>The absence of lsd1 transcripts in asexual embryos is consistent with the absence of yolk in parthenogenetic oocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, identification of lsd1 expression as a specific feature of sexual oogenesis validates the accuracy of our approach.</s><s>Despite the existence of genes known to be involved in meiotic recombination in the pea aphid genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we identified no such genes as specific markers of sexual oocytes.</s><s>However, germline expression of meiotic genes such as spo11 was shown to be similar in sexual and asexual aphids.</s><s>Expression of this gene seems to be modulated between asexual and sexual aphids by alternative splicing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we identified three transcripts that were specific to asexual oogenesis.</s><s>No significant transcription signal has been observed for these genes either in sexual embryos using microarrays (Additional file 3) or in sexual ovaries using WISH.</s><s>That the polypeptide encoded by ACYPI39770 does not bear any similarity to a protein or protein domain of any other organism, suggests that ACYPI39770 is either an orphan gene or a gene with an unusual accelerated evolution rate.</s><s>In Drosophila, cyclin J and lodestar are involved in sexual oogenesis and early embryogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In aphids, their expression profiles suggest that they may haveroles in asexual oogenesis only.</s><s>The absence of lodestar and cyclin J transcripts from aphid sexual oocytes and embryos was particularly unexpected.</s><s>Three lodestar paralogs were identified within the pea aphid genome (ACYPI000753, ACYPI000590 and ACYPI006971).</s><s>Although the three copies were represented on the microarray by copy-specific oligonucleotides, only ACYPI000753 was differentially expressed in sexual and asexual embryos.</s><s>Localization of ACYPI000753 transcripts by in situ hybridization showed that its expression was specific to asexual oocytes.</s><s>However, although the sequence of the riboprobe used to locate ACYPI000753 transcripts was absent from the ACYPI006971 sequence, it shared 87% nucleotide identity with the unregulated paralog ACYPI000590.</s><s>Therefore, cross hybridization between the ACYPI000753 riboprobe and ACYPI000590 transcripts cannot be excluded.</s><s>Nevertheless, we detected no ACYPI000753 expression in sexual oogenesis.</s><s>This unexpected result might reflect the functional specialization of at least one of the lodestar paralogs in asexual oogenesis.</s></p><p><s>Among the 16 transcripts found to be specifically localized in germaria and/or oocytes , lsd1 was the only one for which the expression level was found to be higher in sexual ovaries than in asexual ovaries according to the microarray results.</s><s>This disproportion is consistent with the striking over-representation of transcripts that were upregulated in asexual embryos (29/33), as evidenced by the microarray analysis.</s><s>Sexual oogenesis and asexual oogenesis display major inherent differences.</s><s>Within embryos, the sexual oocyte nucleus remains blocked in meiosis prophase 1 whereas the asexual oocyte undergoes a modified but complete meiotic division immediately after ovulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>This modified meiosis involves specific changes within the oocyte; self-organized asters are formed, that then recruit centriole precursors and pericentriolar material <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This process may be accompanied by the activation of microtubule stabilization factors or by the inactivation of microtubule destabilization factors specific to asexual oogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The predominance of genes that are upregulated in asexual embryos may be partially explained by the production of molecular components that are specifically required for asexual oogenesis but not for sexual oogenesis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aphid rearing, dissection and extraction</head><p><s>Clonal descendants from the sequenced Acyrthosiphon pisum LSR1 clone were reared on Vicia fabae at 18°C and at low density (5 individuals per plant) to prevent the production of winged morphs.</s><s>Parthenogenesis was maintained under long photoperiod (16 h).</s><s>In our conditions, the shortening of the photoperiod (12 h) requires three generations to induce the production of sexual morphs.</s><s>The first asexual generation was reared under long photoperiod and transferred to short photoperiod (12 h) after the third instar moult.</s><s>Adult asexual virginoparae females produced the second asexual generation, named sexuparae.</s><s>Adult sexuparae, reared in short photoperiods, produced the third generation of sexual females oviparous, males, and asexual viviparous females.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kinoprene application</head><p><s>Aphid sexuparae were synchronised at the fourth instar moult, during a 6 hour window.</s><s>24 h after, 400 ng of kinoprene (Sigma Aldrich) diluted in 50 μL of acetone were ectopically applied on sexuparae abdomens of 100 females.</s><s>The progeny of treated aphids was collected daily for 5 days.</s><s>When they reached adulthood, collected aphids were dissected and their reproductive type was determined according to the type of ovaries they contained within their abdomen: sexual ovaries that are only made of haploid eggs, ambiphasic ovaries that contain a mixture of eggs and embryos, and asexual ovaries that are only constituted of embryos at different stages of development.</s><s>Ectopic applications of 50 μL of acetone were performed as a negative control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling, RNA isolation and microarray hybridization</head><p><s>Synchronized sexuparae were randomly divided into 2 batches and treated with kinoprene or acetone (as a control) 24 h after fourth instar moult (Additional file 4). 25 treated sexuparae were collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after kinoprene or acetone application.</s><s>For each condition, the 5 most developed embryos were isolated from each of the 25 treated sexuparae by dissection, pooled together, frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.</s><s>These most developed embryos within treated sexuparae collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment correspond to the developemental stage 18, 19 or 20 respectively.</s><s>This procedure was repeated 5 times to generate as much independent biological replicates.</s><s>Total RNAs were isolated from each sample by using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.</s><s>RNA quality was checked on Bioanalyser (Agilent) and quantified on Nanodrop (Thermo scientific).</s><s>For each sample, 20 μg of total RNAs were sent to the Nimble-Gen expression array platform (Roche).</s><s>Double stranded cDNA synthesis and Cy3 end-labelling were performed by NimbleGen.</s></p></div>
