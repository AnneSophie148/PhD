<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthers of P7-1-OE Plants have Reduced ROS Level</head><p><s>To assess whether the sterility of P7-1-OE flowers was related to plant signaling molecules, we measured the ROS and NO (nitric oxide) levels in both transgenic and wild-type anthers using florescence staining.</s><s>Our results clearly demonstrated that there was no difference in NO content between P7-1-OE and wild-type anthers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</s><s>However, the transgenic anthers accumulated significantly lower levels of ROS than wild-type plants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>We further investigated ROS production in anthers during development by histochemical staining.</s><s>P7-1-OE anthers produced low levels of H 2 O 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>, DAB staining) but equivalent amounts of O 2 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5</ref>, NBT staining) compared with wildtype plants.</s><s>To gain further insight into the low ROS levels in P7-1-OE anthers, we analyzed the expression levels of genes in the ROS network.</s><s>The expression levels of some genes that encode ROS-scavenging enzymes, e.g., cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase1 (cAPX1), ascorbate peroxidase2 (APX2), and Fe superoxide dismutase (FSD1), increased in the P7-1-OE anthers about 2-fold higher than in wildtype, but the levels of ROS-producing related genes, e.g., respiratory burst oxidase homolog A (RBOHA) and respiratory burst oxidase homolog B (RBOHB), were reduced in the transgenic anthers compared with the wild type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>).</s><s>These results show that the accumulation of ROS in anthers prior to dehiscence is nearly absent when RBSDV P7-1 is ectopically expressed.</s></p></div>

Arabidopsis produced plants with male sterility resulting from non-dehiscent anthers (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), which approximately mimicked the disease symptoms observed in rice anthers.</s><s>The non-dehiscent anther phenotype of P7-1 transgenic plants was correlated with reduced secondary wall lignification in the endothecium and decreased ROS levels in the anthers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that RBSDV P7-1 is likely to be a pivotal determinant of plant sterility symptoms caused by RBSDV.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies using immunoelectron analysis have revealed that RBSDV P7-1 accumulates in tubular structures in virus-infected maize plants and in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, P7-1 of SRBSDV (southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus), which is most closely related to RBSDV, has the intrinsic ability to form tubules growing from the non-host insect cell surface in the absence of other virus proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Recent researches using live-cell imaging in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves also demonstrate that RBSDV P7-1 protein forms punctuate points at plasmodesmata <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>RBSDV P7-1 characteristics of tubule-forming and plasmodesmata localization suggest that this protein might be involved in virus intercellular movement, in infected insect and plant cells.</s><s>The pathogenesis of tubular proteins during viral morphogenesis has been reported in studies of other members of the family Reoviridae.</s><s>For example, BTV (bluetongue virus) nonstructural tubular protein NS1 plays a direct role in cellular pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>RDV (rice dwarf virus) nonstructural tubular protein Pns10 functions as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing and plays important roles in enhancing viral replication, systemic movement, and invasion of new tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the tubular proteins of reoviruses have multiple functions in viral morphogenesis, viral infection, and virulence.</s><s>In support of this notion, our data show that overexpression of RBSDV tubular protein P7-1 in Arabidopsis causes male sterility, which mimics the phenotype observed in rice flowers infected with the virus.</s><s>It will be interesting to examine whether RBSDV P7-1, like RDV Pns10, can function as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we determined that the male sterility of P7-1-OE transgenic plants was due to the failure of anther dehiscence and pollen release, which may have been caused by the lack of lignification in the anther endothecium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>Actually, secondary lignified thickening in the endothecium is critical for providing the mechanical force required for anther dehiscence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>This mechanism has been demonstrated experimentally by analyzing Arabidopsis mutants such as myb26 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, NST1 (SECONDARYWALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1), and NST2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In these mutants, reduced lignification of anther endothecium results in anther indehiscent and male sterility.</s><s>Furthermore, the triple ccc mutant, which carries mutations in monolignol biosynthesis genes, including CCR1 (cinnamoyl CoA reductase1), CAD c (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase c), and CAD d, displays severe male sterility due to the lack of lignification in the anther endothecium <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we showed that the transcriptional levels of the lignin biosynthesis genes 4CL, CCoAOMT, and C3H were reduced in the flowers of RBSDV P7-1 transgenic plants compared with the flowers of wild-type plants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>), although the expression levels of CCR1, CAD c, and CAD d were unchanged in the transgenic plants (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, the reduced lignification of anthers is responsible for male sterility in P7-1-OE transgenic plants.</s><s>Figure 3. Scanning electron micrographs of anthers (A) and pollen grains (B) of P7-1 transgenic and wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079514.g003</s><s>It is well-established that secondary lignification in cell walls is dependent on the oxidative coupling of monolignol to form the polymer lignin, which is catalyzed by H 2 O 2 -dependent peroxidases and O 2 -dependent laccase <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>In the endodermal cells of roots, subcellular precision of lignin polymerization is achieved by restricted, localized peroxidase activity and the production of ROS substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In the secondary thickening that occurs in anthers, lignin polymerization is dependent on the H 2 O 2 contents.</s><s>For example, Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing gamma carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) have significantly lower ROS contents than wild type, which results in a reduction in the H 2 O 2dependent polymerization pathway for lignin formation during anther development and accordingly, causes male sterility <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Our data also show that ectopic expression of RBSDV P7-1 in Arabidopsis causes male sterility in conjunction with low ROS contents in anthers compared with wild-type plants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the male sterility of P7-1 transgenic plants is primarily achieved by the combinatorial action of reduced monolignol and ROS contents.</s><s>In the future, it will be important to untangle the relationship between reduced production of ROS or lignin and RBSDV tubular protein P7-1.</s><s>Such information would significantly deepen our mechanistic understanding of the role of RBSDV P7-1 in viral virulence.</s></p></div>
