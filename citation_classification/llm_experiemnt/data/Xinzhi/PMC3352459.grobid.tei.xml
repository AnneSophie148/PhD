<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Resistance of pest species to control methods allows us to study evolution on an ecological time scale.</s><s>Evolution of resistance to synthetic toxins may present information relating to how organisms respond to naturally occurring chemicals in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Scott et al. 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Behavioral resistance, however, could provide insight into how animals interact with the environment in activities such as host location or ovipositional choice.</s><s>Molecular changes associated with resistance to a toxin have been frequently investigated, but no study to date has demonstrated a link between gene expression and behavioral resistance.</s></p><p><s>In the agriculturally intensive landscape of the Midwest of the USA, the western corn rootworm beetle, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), typically requires fields planted with corn (Zea mays L.) in consecutive years to complete its life cycle.</s><s>Eggs hatch in late spring, and the larvae feed on corn roots.</s><s>Adults emerge midsummer, and females lay eggs in the soil of cornfields, after which the eggs overwinter in obligatory diapause.</s><s>The only crop plant on which larvae can survive is corn, so yearly rotation of crops (i.e., annual alternation of corn with another crop in the same field) has been a major control method.</s><s>However, D. v. virgifera has evolved behavioral resistance to crop rotation in a large portion of the midwestern USA.</s><s>Rotation-resistant females also lay eggs in noncorn fields, namely soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], that will be planted with corn the following spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Levine and Oloumi-Sadeghi 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Even though females in regions where resistance is present may lay eggs indiscriminately in a variety of crops, including corn <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rondon and Gray 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schroeder et al. 2005)</ref>, and soybean fields can also act as a strong selective force.</s><s>Virtually, all soybean fields are rotated to corn the following spring in areas with rotation resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Onstad et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Onstad et al. , 2003))</ref>, and, indeed, soybean fields may receive more D. v. virgifera oviposition than cornfields <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pierce and Gray 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The proportion of the landscape devoted to annual corn:soybean rotation is a major predictor in whether rotation resistance will spread to a given area <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Onstad et al. 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our current hypothesis concerning the rotation-resistant behavioral phenotype is that resistant females show reduced fidelity to corn as a host <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Levine et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Spencer and Levine 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Rotation-resistant females are not necessarily attracted to soybeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Spencer et al. 1999)</ref>, nor can they survive on a diet composed strictly of soybean foliage <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mabry and Spencer 2003)</ref>, but they may benefit more from soybean herbivory than wild-type (WT) females <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mabry et al. 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Adult beetles commonly leave corn fields as the plants senesce <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Darnell et al. 2000)</ref> and are more likely to feed on soybean foliage as corn becomes an undesirable food source <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(O'Neal et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">O'Neal et al. (2004)</ref> proposed a behavioral plasticity model for rotation resistance, in which early senescence of corn because of early planting repels adult beetles from corn fields, and no genetic change has occurred in beetle populations.</s><s>However, resistant females are found in soybean fields even when corn tissues are optimal for adult feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rondon and Gray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pierce and Gray 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">LMK personal observation)</ref>.</s><s>Rotation resistance is likely to be a genetic trait, based on characteristics of the geographical spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Onstad et al. 1999</ref>).</s><s>The spread did not follow latitudinal isolines as would be expected under a scenario of early planting, even though an analysis of planting date has not been conducted.</s><s>Behavioral studies also suggest that a genetic change has occurred because rotation-resistant females exhibit increased locomotor activity and tendency to take flight, which would increase the chances that they will leave their natal cornfield and lay eggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Knolhoff et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>A simple model of the evolution of rotation resistance suggests that this behavioral change is likely because of one major allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Onstad et al. 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, many questions remain.</s><s>A significant piece of the puzzle lies in finding a molecular mechanism or marker for rotation resistance.</s><s>Mapping approaches to find a marker have been difficult because the genome is rather large <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sappington et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>None of the eight microsatellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kim and Sappington 2005)</ref> tested so far are associated with resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miller et al. 2006</ref>), but a few newly characterized loci have yet to be tested in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kim et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">). Miller et al. (2007)</ref> conducted an analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphisms, but, of the 253 polymorphic loci they found, only one seems to be weakly associated with resistance.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Garabagi et al. (2008)</ref> report small expression differences in the D. v. virgifera ortholog of the foraging gene in relation to rotation resistance.</s><s>The foraging gene codes for a cGMPdependent protein kinase involved in behaviors relating to host finding and acceptance in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pereira and Sokolowski 1993)</ref> and other insects (for a recent review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kaun and Sokolowski 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, the two populations used for comparison were laboratory colonies that are no longer subjected to selection for desirable behavioral traits in their given native landscape.</s></p><p><s>Genetic markers are often derived using mapping approaches, but one desirable feature of microsatellites, for example, might present a problem.</s><s>One of the reasons microsatellite markers are chosen is because they are selectively neutral among populations.</s><s>The rotation resistance trait, however, does have a selective advantage in landscapes with a high proportion of yearly corn:soybean rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Onstad et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Onstad et al. , 2003))</ref>, so perhaps it would be easier and more useful to take a more functional approach.</s><s>One option is to use microarrays to find changes in gene expression relating to the rotation resistance trait.</s><s>Two results could arise: (i) the proposed mutation for the trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Onstad et al. 2001</ref>) could be present in a sequence of interest, which would be either expressed or not or (ii) observed differences in gene expression could be the result of a mutation that is upstream in a given pathway.</s><s>The latter result will not directly provide the polymorphism responsible for the rotation resistance trait, so further work would be necessary to determine the responsible mutation.</s><s>A molecular mechanism would be easier to ascertain in the first scenario, but a marker for the trait could be found with either result, i.e., a marker does not need a mechanism to be useful.</s><s>A molecular marker for rotation resistance has many applications in studying population dynamics and in sampling for emergent resistance in a given area.</s><s>Another feature is that colony maintenance of behaviorally resistant insects can be verified with a molecular marker.</s><s>Finally, a marker could provide insight into novel targets for management of rotation resistance.</s></p><p><s>Reasoning that genes controlling differences in dispersal and host-selection behavior are likely to be expressed in the brain, we therefore searched for gene expression differences in heads of female beetles using a cDNA-based microarray.</s><s>Candidate genes from the microarray were validated with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for possible use as markers and to postulate a potential mechanism for behavioral resistance to crop rotation.</s><s>This study presents a link between behavioral resistance to crop rotation and an associated molecular trait.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p><s>To test for differences in gene expression in adult females between the two behavioral types, three populations of each type were collected in Illinois in July 2006.</s><s>Samples of a rotation-resistant and a WT population were collected as pairs on the same day when growing degreedays approximated 750-800 (accumulated since beginning of calendar year, base 11Â°C, depth 10 cm).</s><s>This was carried out to minimize any beetle phenology effects resulting from differences in latitude; females were postteneral and most likely preovipositional.</s><s>Rotationresistant adults (Urbana, Pontiac, and Grand Ridge) were collected from first-year cornfields, and WT adults (Perry, Monmouth, and Morrison) were collected from continuous cornfields (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), defined as a field planted with corn two or more consecutive years.</s><s>Because the sampled populations in this experiment are widely separated (&gt;45 km), even within a given type, observed expression differences are not likely to be an artifact of local adaptation in one population.</s><s>Status of rotation resistance in a population was confirmed by multiple lines of evidence.</s><s>Most important was whether a given area had experienced consistent damage by D. v. virgifera larvae in first-year corn (defined as corn planted the year after another crop) over recent years.</s><s>In addition, three sweep net samples of 100 sweeps were taken from soybean fields adjacent to cornfields where D. v. virgifera beetles were collected.</s><s>Beetles present in sweep net samples from soybean fields indicate the presence of rotation resistance; a range of 10-20 beetles per 100 sweeps is a good predictor of rotation resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Onstad et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Onstad et al. , 2003))</ref>.</s><s>Finally, behavioral tests on individual beetles [n = 30 (approximately) per population] were conducted in an Urbana cornfield 1-2 days after collection.</s><s>Rotation-resistant females exhibit increased locomotor behavior and are more likely to take flight in a behavioral bioassay <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Knolhoff et al. 2006</ref>).</s></p></div>
