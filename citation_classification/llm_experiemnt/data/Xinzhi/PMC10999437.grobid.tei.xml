of non-linear development rate functions at individual level.</s><s>However, the life history of P. spumarius poses a challenge for establishing individual-based experiments due to the difficulty of maintaining individualised breeding of the preimaginal stages, making more convenient the development of cohort-based experiments.</s><s>Although there are reliable demographic methods for the

control of the physiological age of individuals characterising the cohorts at the beginning of the experiment.</s><s>In such cases, accurately estimating development rate functions becomes significantly challenging, as the observed distribution of stage durations can be attributed to both the natural intrinsic differences in developmental rates and to the distribution of the physiological age of the insects at the experiment's onset.</s><s>To overcome such barriers, researchers have proposed the use of mechanistic non-linear simulation models for the estimation of life

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The diapause process of P. spumarius remains relatively underexplored in the literature.</s><s>The few available studies are often influenced by the environmental and climatic conditions in which they were conducted and the specific traits of the spittlebug populations under investigation, lacking of generalization.</s><s>For instance, Lago et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>roposed that the eggs leave diapause on December 1st, by fitting a model of development of post-diapausing eggs to field data from the Iberian Peninsula, while Chmiel and Wilson 18 assumed that this process occurs in January 1st, based on field data of populations from the Northern United States.</s><s>Our study is the first attempt to build a mechanistic approach describing the diapause termination in P. spumarius in terms of accumulation of heat energy by the diapausing eggs, providing a general model applicable to different climatic contexts.</s><s>We estimated that the termination of eggs diapause occurs after accumulating 120 DD above a lower temperature threshold of 6.5 °C, starting from the 1st of January, this means, for example, that eggs typically start leaving diapause after mid-February in the Italian locations investigated in this paper.</s><s>In our model, we rely on the simplified assumptions that only thermal accumulation triggers egg diapause termination, although the contribution of cold temperatures and photoperiod are reported as factors that influence the duration of diapause <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Howev</s><s>r, the possibility of including the cold temperature in our model requires the availability of a rate function describing the relationship between cold temperature and diapause duration, not yet explored in literature.</s></p><p><s>The estimated initial physiological age distribution of eggs is in line with the results of Weaver and King 7 and Witsack <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>They suggested that part of the embryonic development of P. spumarius occurs during fall.</s><s>Consequently, first egg hatchings are expected to be observed shortly after diapause termination, with temperatures above the lower threshold for egg development.</s><s>The range of the estimated distribution of physiological ages of eggs (varying from 0.58 to 0.99) might be partially in contrasts with the study of <ref type="bibr">Witsack 8</ref> on the embryonic development of P. spumarius during the onset of diapause.</s><s>This author observed that eggs entered diapause in a specific step of embryogenesis, without providing information on the physiological age   of this transition neither an associated estimation of inter-individual physiological ages.</s><s>The wide range of physiological age obtained from the optimization procedure adopted for our model estimation could be possibly an outcome of uncontrolled variables intervening in the experimental process together with inter-individual variability in the physiological age at the onset of diapause.</s></p><p><s>The lower temperature threshold of post-diapausing eggs (3.0 °C) is lower than those defined by Chmiel and Wilson 18 of 6.5 °C, and by Lago et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>of 9.2 °C.</s><s>In the latter study, the authors estimated an optimum temperature for the post-diapausing eggs of 23.4 °C, substantially lower than our estimate (28.3 °C), although the upper development thresholds were similar (35 °C).</s><s>However, the experimental design followed by Lago et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>and the functional form of the development rate function is different from the non-linear function used in our model, these two elements could partially account for the different results obtained.</s><s>Chmiel and Wilson 18 estimated a lower temperature threshold for nymphs similar to the one we estimated (3.0 °C), but lower than the 5.0 °C assumed by Halkka and Halkka <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Our estimate of the upper development temperature threshold of 33.0 °C for the nymphs is much higher than the results of the study of Chmiel and Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>These authors estimated an upper threshold equal to 26.7 °C, a value closer to the optimal development rate temperatures estimated in our study.</s><s>The possibility that differences in the development rate functions of the egg and the nymphal stages we obtained compared to the values found by other authors can be related to the different adaptation to local climatic conditions (especially during late winter and spring, to which the spittlebug populations are exposed) remains a factor to be investigated.</s></p><p><s>Control strategies targeting the nymphal population are important to reduce the further emergence of adults in the field, which are effectively responsible for transmitting Xf to the crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The main management strategies of the spittlebug

insecticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>The phenological curves estimated for the 3rd-5th nymphal instars by our phenological model presented a satisfactory fit to the field populations in location where the model has been tested in Italy.</s><s>This suggests that our phenological model is appropriate for the estimation of the emergence of the three late nymphal stages, which are the key stages to target monitoring actions and control measures against P. spumarius.</s><s>According to Bodino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , the peak of emergence of the 4th instar nymphs represents a crucial moment for maximizing the efficacy of management strategies targeting the nymphal population, since it coincides with the peak of the nymphal abundance, when no more nymphs eclose, and no adults are yet present.</s><s>These phenological dynamics can also be observed in the population surveys conducted by Chmiel and Wilson 18 , Zajac et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , Antonatos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , and Beal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , which were performed in different agroecological landscapes contexts and climatic conditions.</s></p><p><s>Even though our model is able to predict the emergence curve of P. spumarius adults, we could not evaluate the simulated emergence patterns due to the lack of real data.</s><s>The adults present a greater dispersal ability than the nymphal stages and usually leave the herbaceous cover once they emerge and move onto shrubs and trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>This shift in habitat occupation demands distinct methodologies for surveying this stage, making it challenging to gather field data that captures the cumulative emergence necessary for the evaluation of the model's predictions.</s><s>Nevertheless, the model provides valuable biological information about adult emergence that contributes significantly to the understanding of the species phenology and the integration of the model into epidemiological models.</s></p><p><s>The estimated phenological model emerges as a useful rational decision support tool guiding growers and decision-makers scheduling monitoring and control actions against the late nymphal stages of P. spumarius.</s><s>The model provides accurate information for the identification of appropriate phenological timing for interventions, as it can simulate local phenology based on the weather temporal trends, thus enhancing management precision.</s><s>Furthermore, it can be used to generate maps at different spatial resolutions to manage actions at the level of productive patches, incorporating the role of spatial variability in the vector's phenological progression.</s><s>The model can be easily adapted to be used in other regions through further parameter calibration using reliable field datasets from the contexts of interest.</s><s>It can also be implemented into Xf epidemiological model frameworks (e.g.</s><s>Gilioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> ), in order to enhance the realism of the representation of the vector dynamics.</s><s>In this way, such complex models can guide researchers and decision-makers to investigate optimal management strategies under the IPM context to prevent and mitigate the spread of the Xf epidemics.</s><s>In addition, they can also provide important insights, improve the knowledge about this complex epidemiological system, and highlight the research topics and gaps that need to be approached.</s><s>In the context of our study, there are still important limitations in the understanding of the biological processes involved in the diapause dynamics of P. spumarius eggs that are important to be investigated in more detail to allow a more realistic estimation of the diapause termination and egg hatching moments.</s><s>An effort should be made to develop optimized monitoring designs for the spittlebug populations to improve the precision of the surveys in the field 1 , which is a very important decision-making tool for an assertive implementation of control measures.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model parameterization</head><p><s>The parameters a i , T i inf and T i sup of the temperature-dependent development rate functions for the preimaginal stages (Eq.</s><s>1), as well as the initial Beta distribution of physiological age of eggs, are estimated from a set of population dynamics of P. spumarius analysed in a climatic chamber at different constant temperature (D.</s><s>Bosco and N. Bodino, personal information).</s><s>These data are graphically represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>The eggs used in the experiment were obtained from microcosms (cages) containing a couple of adults (male and female) used for oviposition and placed in open-air conditions in Turin (Northern Italy).</s><s>Eggs were collected from September to the beginning of November and stored at the temperature of 4 ± 1 °C to slow down their development until the beginning of the experiments and to maximize their probability of survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>In mid-February, the eggs were removed from storage at 4 °C, placed in climatic chambers at four constant temperatures (10, 18, 24, and 30 °C) and followed in their development until adult emergence or death.</s><s>Nine replicates for each temperature were carried out.</s><s>The number of eggs hatched and the number of individuals in each nymphal stage were recorded three times a week.</s></p><p><s>The cumulative emergence curves, representing the phenological dynamics of preimaginal stages of P. spumarius for each temperature, were approximated by Gamma distributions.</s><s>Since there was no control of the oviposition date of the eggs collected in the microcosm, the physiological age of the eggs at the beginning of the experiment can vary considerably.</s><s>Due to the characteristics of the climatic chamber experiment, we did not consider the diapausing phase in this step.</s></p><p><s>The Kolmogorov model has been used for simulating the emergence of both the preimaginal and the adult stages.</s><s>The stage-specific development rates and temperature thresholds, as well as the initial physiological age distribution of eggs (based on the Beta distribution), have been estimated by fitting the experimental data with the Kolmogorov model through the following minimization procedure.</s><s>We iteratively modified some of the model parameters (i.e. the stage-specific development curves and the initial physiological age distribution of eggs) to minimize the differences between the four observed phenological curves of the preimaginal stage and the estimated ones (function fmincon, MATLAB v. 9.14 R2023a).</s><s>As stopping conditions, we set the threshold related to the difference in the parameter's values between steps (step tolerance = 1.0e-6) and the difference in the error minimization (function tolerance = 1.0e-1).</s></p></div>
