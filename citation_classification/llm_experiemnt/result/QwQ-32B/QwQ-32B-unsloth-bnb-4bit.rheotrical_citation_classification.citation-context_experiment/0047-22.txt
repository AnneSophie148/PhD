Okay, let me tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to understand what role the citation is playing. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. That sounds like the current study is using the setup from the previous work. So the citation is referring to a method or experimental setup that's being utilized here.

Looking at the classes, the Usage category is for when a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work is directly used. The example provided for Usage is almost identical: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So that's a clear match. 

Let me double-check the other options to be sure. Support would be if the citation is backing a claim, but here it's more about using the setup, not supporting a finding. Basis might be if it's the foundation, but Usage is more specific here. Neutral is just a mention without any argumentative role, but the usage here is explicit in adopting the setup. So yes, Usage is the right choice.
