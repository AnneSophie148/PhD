Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) placeholder. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". The citation is comparing the current study's results with those of the cited work. Let me check the classes again. 

Looking at CoCoRes: "Assign this class when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." That seems to fit here because they're contrasting their results with the cited study's results. 

Wait, let me make sure there's no better fit. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support is when it's used to back up a claim, but here it's a contrast. Similar is pointing out similarity, but they mention differing results. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice here. The example even has a similar structure to the given example for CoCoRes. 

I don't see any other class that matches this scenario. The citation is directly comparing the results, so the answer should be CoCoRes.
