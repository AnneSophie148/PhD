Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The user provided an example where the citation is about a study showing that a peptide interferes with virus uptake and also binds to other aphid species' gut epithelia, suggesting broader applicability. The task is to assign the correct class from the list provided.

First, I should recall the definitions of each class. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

The example given under "Future" is when the citation suggests future research directions. The example there mentions a peptide's broader applicability as a suggestion for future work. The passage in question here says that the peptide's binding to other species "suggests potential broader applicability," which seems like pointing out a direction for future research. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. "Support" is when the citation supports the authors' findings. But here, the citation is used to suggest that the peptide might work in other cases, implying future exploration. "Future" class examples include when the citation implies directions for future research, like the example given. 

"Similar" is when there's a similarity between the cited work and the current paper, but here the focus is on the potential for broader use, not similarity. "Motivation" is about justifying why the current research is done, but this seems more about suggesting where to go next. 

Yes, I think "Future" is the right class here because the citation is highlighting a possibility that could be explored further, which is exactly the example provided under the Future class.
