Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage and needs me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key here is to see how (CITSEG) is being used in this sentence. The sentence is comparing the current results with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is a direct comparison of the outcomes. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That seems to fit here. The example provided under CoCoRes also mentions a difference in results, which matches the structure here. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the citation was backing up the current findings, but here it's contrasting. Weakness is criticizing the cited work, which isn't happening hereâ€”just a difference in results. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice.
