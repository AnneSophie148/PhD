Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The example given is about a study where a peptide's effect on virus uptake in aphids and its potential broader applicability.

First, I need to recall the classes. The key ones here might be "Future" since the example mentions "suggest potential broader applicability." The task is to see if the citation is pointing out future directions. The example sentence says the peptide bound to other species, suggesting broader use. The citation here is supporting the idea that this could be a direction for future research. 

Wait, the "Future" class is when the citation is used to suggest future research. The example given under Future is about a peptide that "suggests potential broader applicability," which matches the example. The citation is being used to imply that there's more to explore here, so that's Future. 

Alternatively, could it be "Support"? But "Support" is when it's backing up a claim the authors make. Here, the authors are saying that because the peptide worked in one case, maybe it's applicable elsewhere, which is more about future directions than supporting their own results. So "Future" seems right. 

No other classes fit better. "Similar" is about pointing out similarities, but the key word here is "suggesting potential broader applicability," which is a future direction. So the answer should be Future.
