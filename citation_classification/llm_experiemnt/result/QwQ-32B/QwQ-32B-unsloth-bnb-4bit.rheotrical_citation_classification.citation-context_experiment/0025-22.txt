Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example again carefully.

The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

The task is to assign the most appropriate class from the list provided. Let me go through each possible class to see which fits best.

First, the sentence is comparing the results of the current work with those of the cited study. The key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results," which indicates a direct comparison of the outcomes between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes:

- **Basis**: This is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. The example given for Basis mentions replicating results, which isn't the case here. The current work is contrasting results, not building upon them.

- **CoCoGM (Comparison of Goals or Methods)**: This would apply if they were comparing the goals or methods, but the example is about results differing, so this doesn't fit.

- **CoCoRes (Comparison of Results)**: This seems spot on because the sentence directly compares the results of the present work with the cited study's results. The example given for CoCoRes also uses similar wording like "substantially differ from the results of the experiments," which matches exactly.

- **CoCoXY (Comparison of Explanations or Claims)**: This is when two cited studies are compared, not the citing paper with another. Here, the citing paper is comparing its own results with the cited one, so CoCoXY isn't right.

- **Future**: This is for suggesting future research, which isn't the case here.

- **Motivation**: If the citation was explaining why the current research is needed, like pointing out a gap, but the example is contrasting results, so no.

- **Neutral**: A neutral citation doesn't involve comparison or argument, which isn't the case here since they are contrasting results.

- **Similar**: If the results were similar, but here they are differing, so not this.

- **Support**: If the citation supported the current findings, but since they differ, it's the opposite, so not support.

- **Usage**: If they used a method from the cited work, which isn't mentioned here.

- **Weakness**: If pointing out flaws in the cited work, but the example is just stating a difference, not criticizing the cited work's quality.

Therefore, the correct class is **CoCoRes** because it's a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study.
