Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) placeholder. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The passage says: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Looking at the context, the citation is mentioned in the sentence where the authors state that their previous work showed a phenomenon but didn't explain it. Now, this current work aims to address that gap. The key part here is "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown..." which indicates that the cited work identified a knowledge gap, prompting the current research. 

Now, checking the classes: The Motivation class is for when the citation justifies the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap or need. The example for Motivation matches this scenario exactly. The Basis class is when the cited work is the foundation, but here it's more about identifying a gap rather than being the foundation. Support would be if they were confirming previous results, but here it's about moving forward because a prior study didn't explain something. So, the correct class here is Motivation.
