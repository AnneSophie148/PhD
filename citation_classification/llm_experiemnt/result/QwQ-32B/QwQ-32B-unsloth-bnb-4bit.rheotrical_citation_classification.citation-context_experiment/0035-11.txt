Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The user provided a list of classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. Let me read the example again.

The example given is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is "suggesting potential broader applicability." That sounds like the citation is being used to imply that future research could explore this broader applicability. The word "suggesting" points towards future directions. The example under the "Future" class mentions "suggest or imply directions for future research." That matches here. The citation is pointing out that since the peptide worked in other species, maybe there's more to research here. So the rhetorical class here is Future. Let me check other options just in case. 

Could it be Support? If the citation is supporting the idea of broader applicability, but the wording is more about suggesting future work rather than confirming a result. The example for Support uses "supported by recent investigations," which is different. 

Weakness? No, there's no criticism here. Similar? It's not pointing out a similarity but suggesting potential. So yeah, Future seems right.

Future
