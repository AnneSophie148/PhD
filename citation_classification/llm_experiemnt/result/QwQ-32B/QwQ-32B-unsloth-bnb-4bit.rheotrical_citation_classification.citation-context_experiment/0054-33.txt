Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage where a citation is marked with (CITSEG), and I need to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to from the given list. 

First, I need to carefully read the example passage and understand the context around the citation. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the possible classes, I should check each one to see which fits best. Let's go through them one by one.

The "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. In the example, the sentence says the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. That sounds exactly like the "Usage" class because they are using the previous work's experimental setup in their current study. 

Let me check the other options just to be sure. "Basis" is when the cited work is the foundation of the current research. Here, it's more about using a specific experimental setup, not the foundation. "Support" would be if the citation supports a claim, but here it's about describing the setup. "Neutral" is just a descriptive mention without argumentation, but since they are referring to using the setup from the cited work, it's more specific than neutral. "Similar" is about pointing out similarities, which isn't the case here. "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" involve comparisons, which aren't present. "Weakness" is criticism, which isn't here either. "Future" is about suggesting future research, which it's not. "Motivation" is justifying why the research is done, which also isn't the case. 

So the best fit is "Usage" because they are directly using the experimental setup from the cited work.
