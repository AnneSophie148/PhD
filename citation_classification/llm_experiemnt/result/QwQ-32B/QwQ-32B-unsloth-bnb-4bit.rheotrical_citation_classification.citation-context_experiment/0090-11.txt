Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key here is to figure out what role the citation is playing here. The sentence says that their current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited work. That sounds like a direct comparison of the results between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings with the citing paper. That seems to fit here because they are contrasting their results with those in the citation. 

Let me double-check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper vs the cited one. Support would be if the citation backs their results, but here it's a contrast. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice.
