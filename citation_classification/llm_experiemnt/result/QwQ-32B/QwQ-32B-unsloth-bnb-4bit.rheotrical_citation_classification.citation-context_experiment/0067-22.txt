Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). First, I need to read the example carefully.

The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Looking at the rhetorical classes, the Usage category is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example here mentions that the experimental setup was described before, so the current study is using that setup. That fits perfectly under Usage because they're referring to a prior method or setup that they're utilizing now. Let me check the other options just to be sure. 

Basis would mean the cited work is the foundation, but here it's specifically about the setup. Support is about supporting a claim, which isn't the case here. Similar is about similarities in results, which isn't mentioned. Neutral is just a descriptive mention, but the key here is that they used the setup from the cited work. Yeah, Usage is definitely the right choice here.
