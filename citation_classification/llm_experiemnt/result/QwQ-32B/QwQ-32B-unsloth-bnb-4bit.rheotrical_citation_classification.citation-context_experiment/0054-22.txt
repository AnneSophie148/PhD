Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The user provided an example where the citation is about a peptide interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability. The options are things like Future, Support, Similar, etc.

The example given under "Future" is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The key words here are "suggesting potential broader applicability," which points to future directions. The Future class is for when the citation implies directions for future research. 

Looking at the other classes: Support is when it's used to back up the current paper's claims. Similar is pointing out similarities. But in the example, the citation is used to suggest that the peptide might work more broadly, which is hinting at future applications or research. So the correct class here would be Future. Let me check the options again to make sure. Yeah, Future is when the citation is used to suggest future research, which matches the example given. I don't think it's Support because it's not directly supporting their own results but pointing out potential for more research. So the answer should be Future.
