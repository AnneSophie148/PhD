Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a scientific article citation passage where I need to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is that the current results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" indicates a direct comparison of their findings. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided under CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other classes don't fit as well. For instance, Support would be if the citation was backing up the current results, but here they're contrasting. Similarly, CoCoGM is about methods or goals, not results. So CoCoRes is the right choice here.
