Okay, let's see. I need to classify this citation into one of the given classes. The user provided a passage with (CITSEG) as the citation placeholder. The task is to figure out the rhetorical class based on how the citation is used in the context.

First, I should read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key here is that the current paper's results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" is a big clue. The class CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results or findings between the cited and citing papers. That seems to fit here. Let me check the definitions again to be sure.

CoCoRes: Assign when comparing results or findings directly. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical to the user's example. The user's example says the results differ, which is a contrast. So that's definitely CoCoRes. 

Let me make sure none of the other classes fit better. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, not results. Support is when it's used to back up the current findings, but here it's a contrast. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. Weakness is criticizing, but the example isn't pointing out flaws in the cited work, just differing results. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice here.
