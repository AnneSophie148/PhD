Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". The citing paper is comparing their results with those of the cited work. The rhetorical class that deals with comparing results is CoCoRes. Let me check the definitions again to be sure.

CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast results or findings between the cited work and the current paper. The example provided under CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The current work's results are contrasting with the cited study's results. 

I should make sure none of the other classes fit better. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they were agreeing or reinforcing, but here they're contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work's flaws, but the example is just a difference in results, not pointing out a weakness. So CoCoRes is the right choice here.
