Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. The user provided a list of classes like Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, etc. The task is to determine which one fits best based on how the citation is used in the passage.

The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key here is looking at how (CITSEG) is mentioned. The sentence says that the current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited work. That sounds like a direct comparison of the findings between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example under CoCoRes even has a similar structure: "The results obtained... differ from... (CITSEG)". That matches exactly. 

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they agreed, but here they're contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing, but it's a comparison of results, not pointing out flaws. So CoCoRes is the right choice.
