Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage where a citation (CITSEG) is mentioned, and I need to figure out which rhetorical class it belongs to. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, so the key here is to see how the citation is used in context. The sentence says that their current results "substantially differ" from the cited work's results. The comparison is between the current study's results and those of the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results directly. The example provided under CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other classes like CoCoGM are about methods or goals, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they agreed, but here they are contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work, but the example just says the results differ, not that the cited work is flawed. So CoCoRes seems right.
