Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into based on the given example. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned, and I have to choose the most appropriate class from the list.

First, I'll read through the example again to understand the context. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, so the key here is that the current study's results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The sentence structure is contrasting their findings. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results with the citing paper. That seems to fit here because they're talking about differing results. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but this is about results. Support would be if they agreed, but here they differ. Weakness is about criticizing, but the example isn't pointing out flaws in the cited work, just differing results. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice.
