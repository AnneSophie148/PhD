Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. The example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

First, I should recall the definitions of each class. The user mentioned CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The sentence here is saying that their results are different from the cited work's results. The key part is "substantially differ from the results", which clearly indicates a comparison of the results between the current study and the cited one. 

Let me check other possible classes. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but here it's about results. Support is when it's in agreement, but here they're contrasting. Weakness is criticizing, but the example doesn't say the cited work is flawed, just different. So CoCoRes seems right. The example even has a similar structure to the CoCoRes example given. Yeah, that's the one.
