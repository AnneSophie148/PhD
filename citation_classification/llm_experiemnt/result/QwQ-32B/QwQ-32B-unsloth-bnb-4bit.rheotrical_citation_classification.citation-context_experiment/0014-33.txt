Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The example given is about aphid gut peptides interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability. 

First, I need to recall the classes. The key ones here might be 'Future' since the example mentions potential broader applicability, which sounds like a future direction. Let me check the definitions again. 

The 'Future' class is for when the citation suggests directions for future research. The example given under Future is similar: using a citation to show a suggestion for future work. The passage here says "suggesting potential broader applicability" which implies that the current work or the cited work points to possibilities that could be explored further. 

Alternatively, could it be 'Support'? But 'Support' is when the citation aligns with the authors' findings. Here, the citation is used to suggest that the peptide's application might be broader, which is more about future potential rather than supporting the current findings. 

'Weakness' is about criticizing, which isn't the case here. 'Similar' is pointing out similarity, but the phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is forward-looking. 

Yes, 'Future' seems correct. The citation is used to imply that there's a direction for future research based on the cited work's findings.
