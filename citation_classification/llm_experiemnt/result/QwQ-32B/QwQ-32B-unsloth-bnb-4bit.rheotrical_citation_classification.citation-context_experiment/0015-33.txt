Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) reference. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is looking at how the citation is used. The sentence says that the current results "substantially differ from" the cited work's results. That sounds like a direct comparison of the results between the two studies. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example provided under CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results..." which matches exactly the structure here. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but here it's about results. Support would be if the citation was backing up the current findings, but here they are contrasting. Weakness is criticizing the cited work, but the sentence is comparing results, not pointing out flaws. So CoCoRes seems correct.
