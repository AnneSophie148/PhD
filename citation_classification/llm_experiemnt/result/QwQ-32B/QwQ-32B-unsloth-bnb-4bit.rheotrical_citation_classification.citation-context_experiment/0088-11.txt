Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being referenced here. The sentence says that their current results "substantially differ" from the cited work's experiments. The focus is on comparing the results between the current study and the cited one. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results directly. The example provided under CoCoRes matches this scenario exactly. The other options don't fit as well. For instance, Support would be if the citation was backing up their results, but here it's a contrast. CoCoGM is about methods or goals, which isn't the case here. So CoCoRes seems right.
