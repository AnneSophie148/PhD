Okay, let's see. I need to classify the citation in the given example into one of the predefined rhetorical classes. The user provided a passage and wants me to assign the correct label. Let me start by reading the example carefully.

The example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The sentence is comparing the current results with those of the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. The citation is pointing out a contrast in the results between the current study and the cited one. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results directly. The example given for CoCoRes is almost identical: comparing experimental results. The other classes like Support or Weakness don't fit because it's not about supporting or criticizing, but specifically comparing results. CoCoGM is about methods or goals, not results. So CoCoRes is the right choice here. Let me double-check the definitions to be sure. Yep, CoCoRes is exactly for comparing results. The answer should be CoCoRes.
