Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let's start by reading the example provided. The user mentioned that the citation is about an aphid gut binding peptide interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability. The example given under the "Future" class is similar: it uses a citation to suggest potential broader applicability, which implies pointing out possible future research directions.

The task is to assign the most appropriate class. The options include Future, which is for suggesting future research. The example here says "suggesting potential broader applicability," which aligns with Future because it's indicating that there's more to explore or apply in other areas. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. The "Support" class is for reinforcing the authors' own findings. Here, the citation is about the peptide's applicability, which might support their current work but the key phrase is "suggesting potential broader applicability," which leans towards future directions. 

"Motivation" is about justifying the current research by pointing out a gap. The example here isn't exactly pointing out a gap but rather showing that the peptide could work in other species, which is more about future possibilities. 

"Usage" is about using a method or tool from the cited work. The example isn't about using the method but the results. 

So, "Future" seems the best fit here because it's suggesting where the research could go next.
