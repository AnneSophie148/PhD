Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The example is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The task is to assign the correct class here.

Looking at the options, the Usage class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example mentions that the experimental setup was described before, so the current study is using that setup. That fits Usage perfectly. 

Let me double-check the other classes to make sure. Support would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's about the setup being described previously. Similar is about similarities in results, which isn't the case here. Basis is about foundational work, but the example is about methodology. So yes, Usage is the right choice.
