Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class to the (CITSEG) placeholder. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The example is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to determine the rhetorical role of the citation. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the cited work is supporting or showing a similar finding. The main claim here is about the peptide's broader applicability. The citation is providing evidence that supports the idea of broader applicability because the previous study showed the peptide's effect in other species. 

Looking at the classes, "Support" is when the citation supports, confirms, or reinforces a claim made by the authors. The example sentence uses the citation to back up the statement about broader applicability. Alternatively, "Future" is when it's suggesting future directions, but here the citation is more about supporting the current finding rather than pointing to future work. "Similar" is when pointing out a similarity, but the sentence structure here is using the citation as supporting evidence for the current study's suggestion. 

Wait, the example says "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The citation here is the basis for that suggestion. But actually, the cited work's results (the peptide binding to other species) support the current paper's claim that there's broader applicability. So the citation is used to support the current authors' statement. 

Therefore, the correct class should be Support.
