Okay, I need to figure out the rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me read the example again. The user provided a passage where the citation is talking about a study that showed a peptide interfering with virus uptake in aphids and binding to other species, suggesting broader applicability. The example output is "Future".

Hmm, the task is to assign the correct class from the list. Let me check the classes again. The "Future" class is used when the citation suggests or implies future research directions. The example given for Future is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." 

So in this case, the key phrase here is "suggesting potential broader applicability." That seems to indicate that the cited work points towards possibilities for further research or applications, which aligns with the "Future" class. The citation is not directly supporting their own results, comparing methods, or pointing out a weakness. Instead, it's hinting at where future studies could go. 

Let me double-check the other classes to be sure. "Support" would be if the citation backs up their claim, but here it's more about suggesting future directions. "Motivation" is about justifying the current research, but the example here is about what the cited work suggests for the future. "Similar" is about similarities, but the example's key part is about suggesting broader applicability, which is future-oriented. 

Yes, "Future" is the right choice here.
