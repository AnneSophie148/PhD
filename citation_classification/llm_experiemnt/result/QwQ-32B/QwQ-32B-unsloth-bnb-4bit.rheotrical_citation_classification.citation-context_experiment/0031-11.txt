Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. First, I need to understand the example they gave.

The example passage is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." The task is to figure out which class this falls into. Let me look at the classes again to see which one fits best.

Looking at the classes:

- **Basis**: If the cited work is the foundation of the current research. Here, the setup was described before, so maybe it's foundational? But the example given for Basis mentions replicating results, which isn't exactly the same.

- **CoCoGM**: Comparing goals or methods. The example here is about comparing methods with another paper. The current sentence just mentions using a previously described setup, not comparing methods.

- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results. Not applicable here since it's about the setup, not results.

- **CoCoXY**: Comparing two cited studies. No, this is just one citation.

- **Future**: Suggesting future research. The example here is about a previous setup, not future work.

- **Motivation**: Justifying why the research is done. The example says the setup was described before, so maybe not motivating the current study's need.

- **Neutral**: Used in a neutral way without supporting or comparing. The sentence is descriptive: "was described in details previously." It's just stating that the setup was detailed elsewhere without any argument or comparison.

- **Similar**: Pointing out similarity between cited and current work. The example here is about the setup being used, not similarity in results.

- **Support**: Supporting a claim with the cited work. The sentence isn't making a claim that the citation supports; it's just referencing prior description.

- **Usage**: When a method/tool from the cited work is used. The example given for Usage is exactly this: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So the citation is referring to a prior description of the method/setup used here. That matches the Usage class.

Wait, the user's example in the prompt under Usage is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So the correct answer here should be **Usage**, since the citation is referring to a method/setup used in the current study. The citation is pointing out that the setup they used was previously described elsewhere. That fits the Usage class perfectly because they are using the cited work's experimental setup.

Double-checking the other options: Neutral might be a distractor, but since the setup is being used in the current study, it's more about usage than just a neutral mention. The key here is that the current study is using the setup from the cited work. So yes, Usage is correct.
