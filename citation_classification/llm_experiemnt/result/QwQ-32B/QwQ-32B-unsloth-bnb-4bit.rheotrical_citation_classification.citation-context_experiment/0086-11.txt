Okay, let's see. I need to classify the rhetorical class of the citation in the given passage. The user provided an example where the citation is about a study showing that a peptide interferes with virus uptake and also binds to other aphid species' gut epithelia, suggesting broader applicability. The example's output is "Future".

Hmm, the task is to determine why the citation is mentioned here. The key part of the example sentence is "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)". The authors are pointing out that the previous work's findings hint at possibilities for future research or applications. The word "suggesting" here is a clue that they're implying where future work could go. 

Looking at the classes, "Future" is used when the citation is suggesting directions for future research. The example given under "Future" mentions "the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability", which aligns with the idea that this study's results open up possibilities that others might explore later. The citation isn't directly supporting their own results, comparing methods, or pointing out a weakness. Instead, it's pointing out that there's potential for more research in this area. 

So the correct class here should be "Future" because the citation is used to imply that there's a direction for future studies to explore the broader applicability mentioned.
