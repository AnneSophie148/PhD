Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine which rhetorical class the citation (CITSEG) falls into. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm. Let me break this down. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the current study's findings are similar to the cited work. The main point here is that the peptide's effect was observed in other species, suggesting broader applicability. The citation is supporting the idea that this peptide has a wider application, based on previous research. 

Wait, the example's output is supposed to be the correct class. The user's example here is actually part of the Future class's example. The Future class is when the citation is used to suggest future research directions. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" seems to point towards future possibilities. 

But let me check the classes again. The Future class example given is exactly this: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." so the correct answer here should be Future. But I need to make sure. 

Alternatively, could it be Support? If the citation is providing evidence for the current study's findings. The sentence says "Similarly," which might mean the cited work supports their current findings. Wait, the example given in the Future class's example is exactly this. Let me check the Future class description again: "Assign this class when the citation is used to suggest or imply directions for future research." The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is pointing towards future research directions, so that's Future. 

But another angle: the citation here is showing that the peptide bound to other species, which supports the current study's similar findings. Wait, maybe the current study is building on that? Or is the citation's work the basis for suggesting broader applicability? The sentence structure is: the cited work showed the peptide interferes with virus uptake and binds in other species, which suggests broader applicability. So the citation is used to imply that there's potential for more research in that direction, hence Future. 

Alternatively, maybe the cited work's result is being used to support the current claim of broader applicability. Wait, but the current study might be the one doing the experiment, and the citation is an example that supports that. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Let me look at the example given for Future: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." which is exactly the example provided here. The user included that as the Future example. Therefore, the correct answer here should be Future. 

So the output is Future.
