Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the list. The example given is about an aphid gut binding peptide interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability.

First, I need to understand the context. The sentence says that a small aphid gut peptide was shown to interfere with virus uptake from pea aphids into the hemocoel. Additionally, the peptide bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species, which suggests potential broader applicability. The citation is pointing out that this previous work supports the idea that the peptide's effect might work beyond just the initial species studied.

Looking at the classes, the "Future" class is for when the citation suggests future research directions. The example given for Future is similar: "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)". The example in the prompt for Future mentions that the citation implies future directions, which aligns with the idea of broader applicability here.

The "Support" class is for when the citation reinforces the authors' own findings. However, in this case, the current work is using the cited study to suggest that there's potential for more research into the peptide's application in other species. It's not exactly supporting their own results but pointing out that this could be a direction to explore further.

"Similar" is about similarities between the cited work and the current paper, but here the emphasis is on the possibility of broader use, not a similarity. "Basis" would be if the cited work was foundational. "CoCoGM" or "CoCoRes" involve comparisons with their own work or other studies, which isn't the case here. "Weakness" is for criticism, which isn't happening here. "Usage" would be if they used a method from the cited work. 

So, the best fit seems to be "Future" because it's suggesting that the cited work indicates potential areas for future research, like testing the peptide in more species.
