Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me start by reading the example given. The user provided a passage where the citation is about a study that showed a peptide's effect on virus uptake in aphids and hints at broader applicability. The example output is "Future".

Looking at the classes, "Future" is used when the citation suggests directions for future research. The example given for Future mentions suggesting broader applicability, which aligns with the example provided. The key here is that the citation is pointing out potential future applications or further research directions. 

Let me cross-check with other classes to be sure. "Motivation" is about justifying the current research, but here it's more about suggesting where future work could go. "Support" would be if the citation backs the current study's findings, but the example says "suggesting potential broader applicability," which is more forward-looking. "CoCoRes" is about comparing results, which isn't the case here. "Usage" is about using a method, which isn't mentioned. "Weakness" is criticizing, which isn't happening here. So "Future" seems correct.
