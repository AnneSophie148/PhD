Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The user provided an example where the passage says, "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is to determine why the citation is being used here. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the current work is pointing out a similar finding. The cited work shows that a peptide interferes with virus uptake and works in other species, suggesting broader applicability. The example given under the "Future" class is exactly like this: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." which is the same as the user's example. The "Future" class is for when the citation suggests future directions. The example for Future says it's about implying directions for future research. In this case, the cited work's findings about broader applicability might be pointing towards future research areas, like testing the peptide in more species or applications. Alternatively, maybe "Support" if it's backing up a claim, but the example under Future matches this structure. Let me check the classes again. 

The Future class example says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." so yes, that's exactly the example given here. So the correct class should be Future. 

Wait, but the user is providing their own example, and the task is to assign the correct class. The user's example matches the Future class's example. Therefore, the answer is Future.
