Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the (CITSEG) reference. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the current work is showing a similar result or building on previous findings. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" seems to point towards future possibilities. Wait, the example given for the 'Future' class is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." which is exactly the example here. The citation here is used to suggest that since the peptide worked in one species and now in others, there's potential for broader use. That aligns with the Future class's example. 

But let me check other possibilities. Could it be Support? The citation supports the idea of broader applicability, but the main point here is the suggestion for future research directions. The example for Future specifically mentions "suggesting potential broader applicability" as part of the Future class. So I think Future is the right choice here. 

Wait, the sentence structure: the citation is supporting the current study's findings (the peptide's broader binding), but the phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is the authors' own conclusion, using the cited work as a basis for that suggestion. The Future class is when the citation is used to imply future research directions. The example given under Future matches exactly this scenario. 

So the correct label should be Future.
