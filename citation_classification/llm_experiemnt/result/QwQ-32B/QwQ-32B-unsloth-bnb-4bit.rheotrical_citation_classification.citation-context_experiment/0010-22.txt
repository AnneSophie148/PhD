Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. Let me start by reading the example given. The user provided a passage where the citation is about a study that showed a peptide interfering with virus uptake in aphids and hints at broader applicability. The example output is "Future".

Looking at the classes, "Future" is used when the citation suggests directions for future research. The example given for Future mentions "suggesting potential broader applicability" which aligns with the example. The key here is that the current paper is pointing out that the cited work's findings could lead to further research or applications. 

Let me check the other classes to be sure. "Support" is when the citation backs up the authors' own findings. Here, it's more about the cited work's implication for future use rather than supporting their current results. "Motivation" would be if the cited work identified a gap that this study is addressing, but the example here is more about suggesting where future work could go, not why the current study was done. "Similar" is about similarities, but the example is about potential applicability, which leans towards future directions. So "Future" seems right.
