Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example again carefully. The example is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

So the key here is to see how the citation is being used here. The sentence is comparing the current results with those of the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. The rhetorical classes I need to consider are the ones related to comparison.

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results directly. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results... (CITSEG)." Wait, that's exactly the same as the example provided here. So that must be the right one. Let me double-check the other options just to be sure.

CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but here it's specifically about results. CoCoXY is comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper对比 with the cited one. The example here is a direct comparison of results between the current work and the cited study, so CoCoRes is the correct choice. The other classes don't fit as well. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
