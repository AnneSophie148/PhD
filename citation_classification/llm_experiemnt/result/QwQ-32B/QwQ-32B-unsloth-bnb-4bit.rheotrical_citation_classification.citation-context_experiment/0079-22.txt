Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example again carefully.

The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes to the (CITSEG) here. Let me go through each class definition again to see which fits best.

First, the classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the sentence: The key point is that the current results "substantially differ from the results" of the cited work. The citation is being used to contrast the results between the present study and the cited one. 

CoCoRes is defined as when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. That seems to fit here because they are comparing their results with the cited study's results, highlighting the differences.

Let me check other possibilities. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, but here it's about results. Support would be if the citation was backing up their claim, but here it's contrasting. Similar is pointing out similarity, but the example says they differ. Weakness is criticizing the cited work, but the sentence is just contrasting results without indicating the cited work's flaws. So CoCoRes is the best fit here. The example given under CoCoRes also mentions contrasting results, which matches exactly.
