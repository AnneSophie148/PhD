Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The example given is about aphid gut peptides interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability.

First, I need to recall the classes. The key ones here might be 'Future' or 'Support' or 'Similar'. Let me check the examples again. The 'Future' class is when the citation suggests future directions. The example given for Future is similar: the peptide's broader applicability is mentioned, which is a suggestion for future research. The citation here is used to imply that since the peptide worked in one species, maybe it works in others, so the authors are pointing towards potential future applications. That fits the Future class. 

Wait, the citation is presented as a finding that shows the peptide's applicability, so maybe 'Support'? But the example for Support is when it's used to back the authors' own claims. Here, the authors are using the cited work to suggest that their own findings (maybe about broader applicability) are supported? Or is it pointing out that the cited work's results suggest there's potential for more research? The example given under Future is similar: "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)". So yes, the example exactly matches the Future class. Therefore, the correct label here should be Future.
