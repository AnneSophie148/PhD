Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is understanding what role the citation plays. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail before, and they're referencing that previous work. So the citation is pointing to a method or procedure that the current study is using. 

Looking at the classes, the "Usage" class is for when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study. That fits here because they're using the previous experimental setup described in the cited work. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. "Support" is for supporting a claim, but here it's more about using the setup, not supporting a result. "Basis" would be if the cited work is the foundation, but the sentence is just stating that the setup was described before. "Similar" is about similarity in results or observations, which isn't the case here. "Usage" seems spot on because they're referring to the experimental setup being used in their current study. 

I think that's right. The answer should be Usage.
