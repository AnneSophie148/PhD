Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage and needs me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So the citing paper is comparing their results with those of the cited work. The citation is pointing out a contrast in the results between the current study and the cited one. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing or contrasting results. The example given under CoCoRes matches this scenario: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from..." which is exactly the case here. 

Let me double-check the other classes to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if the citation was backing up their results, but since it's a difference, that's not it. Weakness is about criticizing the cited work, but the passage is just stating a difference, not pointing out a flaw. So CoCoRes seems right.
