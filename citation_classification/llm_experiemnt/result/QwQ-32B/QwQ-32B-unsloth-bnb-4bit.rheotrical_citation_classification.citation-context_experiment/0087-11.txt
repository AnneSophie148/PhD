Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. So, the current study is using that setup again. 

Looking at the classes, "Usage" is when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup that's directly used in the current study. That seems to fit here because they're reusing the experimental setup from the cited work. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. "Support" would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's more about using the setup. "Basis" is about foundational work, but the example is specifically about the experimental setup. "Similar" is about similarities in results, which isn't the case here. 

So yes, "Usage" is the right class here because they're directly using the experimental setup from the cited paper.
