Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation marked by (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". The citing paper is comparing their results with those of the cited work. The class CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results directly. Let me check the definition again: CoCoRes is for comparing results or findings between the cited and citing papers. That fits here because they are contrasting their results. 

Wait, the example given for CoCoRes in the prompt is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from... (CITSEG)". Wait, actually, the user's example is exactly the example provided for CoCoRes. So the correct class here should be CoCoRes. Let me make sure there's no other possible class. 

Is there a chance it could be Weakness? No, because they are just contrasting results, not pointing out a flaw in the cited work. It's a direct comparison of results, so CoCoRes is the right choice. The answer should be CoCoRes.
