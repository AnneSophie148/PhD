Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The example given is about magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. The sentence says, "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to recall the classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

Looking at the example for Neutral: "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." The example given for Neutral is exactly this scenario. The citation here is just providing a factual statement without any comparison, support, or criticism. It's a neutral mention of a fact.

Let me check other classes to be sure. The sentence isn't comparing the cited work's methods or results (so not CoCoGM or CoCoRes). It's not pointing out a similarity (Similar) because it's a straightforward statement. There's no indication of motivating the current research (Motivation) or supporting a claim (Support). The citation isn't being used to highlight a weakness either. It's just a descriptive statement. 

Therefore, the correct class here is Neutral.
