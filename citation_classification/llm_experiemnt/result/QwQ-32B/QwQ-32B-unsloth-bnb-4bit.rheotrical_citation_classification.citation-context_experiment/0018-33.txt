Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific passage with a citation placeholder (CITSEG) and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class from the given list. 

First, I need to carefully read the example passage they gave. The example is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, looking at the list of classes, I need to see which one fits here. Let me go through each class again to be sure.

The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. That sounds like they are referring to a method or procedure that was used in the current study. The "Usage" class is for when a method, tool, dataset, or setup from the cited work is directly used. That seems to fit here because they are using the previous description of the setup. 

Let me check the example for Usage again: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." Yes, the example provided by the user under Usage matches exactly this scenario. So the correct class here is Usage. 

I should make sure none of the other classes apply. It's not Support because they're not using the citation to back up a claim, just stating that the setup was described before. Not Weakness, since there's no criticism. Not Similar or Comparison classes, as there's no comparison. Definitely Usage.
