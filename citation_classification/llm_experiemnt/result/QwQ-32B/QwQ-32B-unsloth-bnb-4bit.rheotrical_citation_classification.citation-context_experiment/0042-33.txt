Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. The example given is about an aphid gut binding peptide interfering with virus uptake and suggesting broader applicability.

First, I need to understand the context. The sentence says that a small aphid gut peptide was shown to interfere with virus uptake in pea aphids and also bound to gut epithelia of two other species, suggesting potential broader applicability, and cites (CITSEG). The task is to figure out why this citation is used here.

Looking at the classes, the Future class is for suggesting future research directions. The example for Future mentions "suggesting potential broader applicability" which matches the example given here. The sentence here ends with "suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)", so the citation is supporting the idea that this peptide might work in more species, pointing towards future applications. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. The Support class is for when the citation backs up the authors' claims. Here, the citation is more about suggesting where future work could go, not just supporting current findings. The Similar class would be if they were saying other studies also found similar results, but the key word here is "suggesting" future applicability. Weakness is about criticizing, which isn't the case here. Usage would be if they used a method from the cited work. So Future seems correct.
