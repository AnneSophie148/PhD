Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rhetorical class for this citation. The user provided an example where the citation is about a study showing that a peptide interferes with virus uptake and also binds to other aphid species' gut epithelia, suggesting broader applicability. 

First, I'll check the classes again. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The example sentence says that the peptide's effect on one species and its potential broader use is mentioned. The key part here is "suggesting potential broader applicability." The citation here is pointing out that the previous work's findings could lead to future research directions, like testing the peptide in more species or other contexts. That makes me think of the "Future" class because it's implying that there's more to explore based on this study. 

Wait, but let me check the Future example again. The example given for Future is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The citation here is used to suggest that the applicability might be broader, which is pointing towards future research directions. The Future class is for when the citation is used to suggest future research. So yes, this seems right.

Alternatively, could it be Support? If the current paper is building on this to support their own findings, but in the example, the citation is more about the potential for future work rather than supporting the current study's results. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" is more about what could be done next, so Future fits better.

So the answer should be Future.
