Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. First, I need to understand the example given and the classes available.

The example passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Looking at the classes, the possible options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

The key here is to determine why the citation is mentioned here. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the cited work supports a similar finding. The phrase "suggesting potential broader applicability" seems to point towards future possibilities. Wait, the example given under the Future class is exactly this scenario: "suggest potential broader applicability." The example for Future is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide... suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." So that's exactly the example for the Future class. Therefore, the correct class here is Future.
