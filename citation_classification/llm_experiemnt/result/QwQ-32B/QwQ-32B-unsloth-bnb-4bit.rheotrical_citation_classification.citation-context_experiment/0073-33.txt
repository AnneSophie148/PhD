Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage where a citation is marked with (CITSEG), and I need to determine which rhetorical class it belongs to. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I'll read the example passage again: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key part here is "the experimental set-up was described in details previously." So the authors are referring to a prior work where their setup was detailed. That sounds like they are using a method or experimental setup from the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, the Usage category is for when a citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example given for Usage is exactly this scenario: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So that's a direct match. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. Support is when the citation supports a claim, but here it's about using the setup, not supporting a finding. Similar would be if they were saying their setup is similar to another. Basis is about foundational work, but here it's just reusing the setup. Neutral is descriptive but not about usage. Yep, Usage is definitely the right class here.
