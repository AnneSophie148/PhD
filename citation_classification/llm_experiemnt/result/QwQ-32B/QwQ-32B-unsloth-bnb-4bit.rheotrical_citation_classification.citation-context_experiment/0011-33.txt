Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The example given is about magnetic water treatment devices in the USA. The sentence says, "in the USA the use of magnetic water treatment devices has been spreading since 1975 (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to recall the classes. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the sentence, the citation is just stating a fact: the spread of these devices since 1975. The citation here is providing a source for that statement. The key here is whether there's any argumentation role beyond just mentioning a fact. The example given for Neutral is similar: "in the USA... (CITSEG)" which was classified as Neutral because it's a neutral, descriptive use without supporting or comparing. 

The sentence isn't using the citation to support their own findings (Support), or to compare methods (CoCoGM), or to highlight a motivation for their study (Motivation). It's just a factual statement. The example provided under Neutral matches this scenario exactly. Therefore, the correct class should be Neutral.
