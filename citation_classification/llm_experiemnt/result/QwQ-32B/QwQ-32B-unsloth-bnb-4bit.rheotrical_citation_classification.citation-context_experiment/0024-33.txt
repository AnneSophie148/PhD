Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this example. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key part here is that the current results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. The rhetorical classes I have to choose from include CoCoRes, which is for comparing results. Let me check the definitions again.

CoCoRes is when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. The example provided for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work... differ from... (CITSEG)." Wait, actually, the user's example here is exactly the same as the example given for CoCoRes. So that must be the right one. 

Let me make sure none of the other classes fit better. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, not results. Support would be if they agreed, but here they are contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing, but the example isn't pointing out a flaw in the cited work, just a difference in results. So yes, CoCoRes is correct.
