Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. First, I need to carefully read the example given and understand the context.

The passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is mentioned. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate a comparison. Wait, but looking at the options, the Future class is for suggesting future research directions. The example given under Future says something about suggesting broader applicability. The cited work here shows that the peptide works in other species, which the authors use to suggest that it might have broader applicability. That sounds like pointing out a direction for future research. Let me check the Future example again: "suggesting potential broader applicability" is exactly what the Future class's example uses. 

Wait, but another thought: the Support class is when the citation supports the authors' claim. Here, the authors are using the cited work to say that their own findings (maybe about broader applicability) are supported? Or is it suggesting that this previous work indicates there's potential, hence a future direction? The wording "suggesting potential broader applicability" seems like the cited work's results hint at possibilities that the current authors might explore next. So Future makes sense here. 

Alternatively, could it be Similar? If the cited work also found similar results about broader applicability, but the example here is more about implying future research. The example under Future uses similar phrasing. Yeah, I think Future is correct here.
