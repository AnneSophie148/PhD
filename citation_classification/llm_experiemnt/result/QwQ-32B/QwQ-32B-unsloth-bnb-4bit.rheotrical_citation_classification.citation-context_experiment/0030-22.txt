Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". The citing paper is comparing their results with those of the cited work. The class CoCoRes is defined as when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. That seems to fit here. 

Let me check other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about comparing goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support would be if they were agreeing or confirming results, but here they're contrasting. Similar is for pointing out similarities, but the example says they differ. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't mentioned. Weakness is criticizing the cited work, but the example is just a comparison of results, not pointing out flaws. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice here. I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any nuances. The example given under CoCoRes in the prompt is almost identical in structure: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results... (CITSEG)". Wait, actually, the user's example is exactly the same as the CoCoRes example provided. So that's a clear match. Definitely CoCoRes.
