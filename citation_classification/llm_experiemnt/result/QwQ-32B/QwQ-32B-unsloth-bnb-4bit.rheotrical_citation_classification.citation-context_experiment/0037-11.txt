Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a scientific article citation passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class for the citation marked as (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, so the key here is to see how the citation is being used. The sentence is comparing the current results with those of the cited work. The phrase "substantially differ from the results" stands out. That's a direct comparison of the results between the current study and the cited one. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example provided for CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The other classes don't fit as well. For instance, Support would be if the citation was backing up the current results, but here it's a contrast. CoCoGM is about methods or goals, not results. Basis is about foundational work, which isn't the case here. So CoCoRes seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the definitions. CoCoRes is "directly compare or contrast the results or findings". Yes, the sentence is saying their results are different from the cited study's, so that's a contrast of results. So the answer should be CoCoRes.
