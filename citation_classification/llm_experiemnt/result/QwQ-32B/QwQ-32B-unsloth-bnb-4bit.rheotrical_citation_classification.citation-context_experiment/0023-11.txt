Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) placeholder. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The passage says: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The sentence starts with "Similarly," which might indicate that the current study's findings are in line with the cited work. The cited study shows that a peptide interferes with virus uptake and binds to other species' gut epithelia, suggesting broader applicability. The authors are using this to support their own suggestion that their findings might also have broader applicability. Wait, but the example given for the "Future" class is exactly this scenario. The Future class is when the citation is used to suggest future research directions. Let me check the Future example again: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide..." which matches the user's example. The Future example's explanation says it's about suggesting broader applicability, which is exactly what the user's passage is doing. So the citation here is pointing out that the cited work's results suggest potential future applications, hence Future.

Alternatively, could it be Support? The Support class is when the citation supports the authors' own claim. Here, the authors are making a claim about broader applicability based on the cited work. Wait, the sentence structure is: "the peptide also bound to... suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." The citation here is providing evidence that supports the idea of broader applicability, so maybe Support? Or is it Future because it's pointing towards future research directions?

Wait the example given for Future is exactly the same as this. Let me check the Future example again. The user's example for Future is: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)." So the example given under Future is the same as the user's input. Therefore, the correct answer should be Future.

Wait, but in the user's current input, the passage is exactly the same as the Future example. Wait, no, the user's input is the example given for Future. Wait, no, the user provided the task and the example. Wait the user's input here is a new passage, but in their problem, they are asking to classify a new passage. Wait, looking back:

Wait, the user's actual input is the passage: "Similarly, a small aphid gut binding peptide was shown to interfere with enamovirus uptake from pea aphid gut into the hemocoel; the peptide also bound to gut epithelia of two other aphid species suggesting potential broader applicability (CITSEG)."

Wait, but in the original problem description, under the Future class, the example given is exactly this passage. So in this case, the user is providing a passage that is the example for Future, so the correct answer is Future.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again. The user's instruction says: "Prompt for citation classification" and the task is to classify the given passage. The user provided an example under Future which is the same as the input here, so the correct answer is Future. Therefore, the output should be "Future".
