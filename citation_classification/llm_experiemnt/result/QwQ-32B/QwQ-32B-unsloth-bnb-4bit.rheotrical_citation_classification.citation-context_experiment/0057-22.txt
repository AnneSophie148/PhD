Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given example. Let me start by reading the example again carefully.

The example provided is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The task is to assign one of the predefined classes to the citation here. Let me recall the classes again to make sure I have them right. The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

Looking at the sentence, the key part is "the results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results..." So the citing paper is comparing their results with those of the cited work. The citation is pointing out a contrast in the results between their study and the previous one. 

Now, checking the classes again. CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper. That seems to fit here because the sentence is directly comparing the results of the current work with the cited experiments. 

Let me check other possible classes to be sure. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the citing paper's results vs the cited, so CoCoRes is better. Support would be if the citation was backing up their results, but here it's a contrast. Similar is for similarities, which isn't the case. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice here.
