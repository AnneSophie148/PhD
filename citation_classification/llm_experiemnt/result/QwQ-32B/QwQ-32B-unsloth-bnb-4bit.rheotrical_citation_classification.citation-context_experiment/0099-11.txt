Okay, I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in the given passage. Let me start by reading the example carefully. The user provided a passage where (CITSEG) is mentioned, and I have to determine which class it falls into from the list provided.

First, I'll recall the definitions of each class. The key ones here might be Support, Similar, CoCoRes, or maybe Basis. Let me check the example again. The passage says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key phrase here is "substantially differ from the results". That sounds like a direct comparison of the results between the current work and the cited one. The example given for CoCoRes is when the citation is used to compare results, like "The results obtained... differ from... (CITSEG)". That's exactly the case here. 

Let me double-check the CoCoRes definition: "Assign this class when the citation is used to directly compare or contrast the results or findings of the cited work with those of the citing paper." Yes, that matches. The current paper's results are contrasting with the cited work's results. 

I should make sure it's not another class. For instance, Support is when the citation supports the current findings, but here it's a contrast. Similar is for similarities, which isn't the case. CoCoXY is comparing explanations between two cited studies, not with the current paper. So CoCoRes is the right choice here.
