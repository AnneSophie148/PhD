Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The options are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example given carefully. The example says: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key here is looking at how (CITSEG) is being used in the sentence. The main point is that the current results "substantially differ" from those of the cited work. The phrase "differ from the results" suggests a direct comparison of the outcomes or findings between the current study and the cited one. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. That fits here because they are contrasting their results with those in CITSEG. 

Let me check other possibilities. CoCoXY is for comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies, but here it's the current paper vs. the cited one. Support would be if they agreed, but they're contrasting. Weakness is about criticizing, but the example doesn't mention flaws in the cited work, just different results. So CoCoRes is the right choice.
