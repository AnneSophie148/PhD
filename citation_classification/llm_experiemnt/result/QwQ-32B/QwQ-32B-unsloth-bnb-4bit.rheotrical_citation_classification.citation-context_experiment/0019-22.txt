Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage with a citation placeholder (CITSEG) and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class from the list provided. The key here is to carefully read the passage and see how the citation is being used in context.

First, I need to recall the definitions of each class. Let me go through them again quickly:

- **Basis**: The cited work is the foundation of the current research, directly contributing to the new solution or continuing prior work.
- **CoCoGM**: Comparing or contrasting goals or methods between cited work and the current paper.
- **CoCoRes**: Comparing results or findings between the two.
- **CoCoXY**: Comparing explanations or claims between two cited studies (not involving the citing paper).
- **Future**: Suggesting future research directions using the citation.
- **Motivation**: Justifying the current research by pointing out a knowledge gap.
- **Neutral**: Descriptive use without supporting or arguing.
- **Similar**: Pointing out similarities in results, phenomena, etc.
- **Support**: Cited work supports or confirms the authors' claims.
- **Usage**: The cited work's method/tool is used in the current study.
- **Weakness**: Criticizing or pointing out flaws in the cited work.

Now, looking at the example given by the user:

**Example Passage**: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

The task is to classify (CITSEG)'s role here. Let me parse this sentence. The key phrase is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments..." So the current paper's results are being contrasted with those of the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, **CoCoRes** is for comparing or contrasting results between the citing paper and the cited work. The example provided under CoCoRes matches exactly this scenario. The example given by the user even uses "CoCoRes" as the correct class here. Wait, actually, in the user's prompt, the CoCoRes example is exactly this case. So that's a direct match. 

Let me double-check other possible classes. Could this be **Weakness**? No, because the citation isn't pointing out flaws in the cited work but rather contrasting results. **Support** would be if the cited work's results supported the current ones, but here they differ. **Similar** is about similarities, so not this. **CoCoGM** is about methods or goals, not results. 

Therefore, the correct class here is **CoCoRes**.
