Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a passage and wants me to determine the rhetorical class of the citation (CITSEG). The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness. 

First, I need to read the example passage carefully. The example given is: "The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key part here is that the current work is addressing a gap mentioned in the cited work. The cited work (CITSEG) is the previous research by the authors which showed that magnetic fields prevent scale formation but didn't explain the mechanism. The current study's purpose is to address that gap. 

Looking at the classes, "Motivation" is when the citation is used to justify why the current research is being done, like pointing out a knowledge gap. The example given for Motivation is similar: "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown... The explanation... is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is..." which matches exactly the structure here. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. "Basis" is when the cited work is the foundation, but here it's more about a gap. "Support" would be if they're confirming a result, but here it's about motivating the current study. "Future" is suggesting future directions, but here it's the current work's motivation. So "Motivation" fits best.
