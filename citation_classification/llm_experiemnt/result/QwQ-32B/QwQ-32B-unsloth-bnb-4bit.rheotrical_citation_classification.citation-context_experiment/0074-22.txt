Okay, let me try to figure out the correct class for this citation. The user provided a passage where the citation is mentioned. The task is to determine which rhetorical class the (CITSEG) falls into based on the example given.

First, I need to read the example passage again: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)." 

Hmm, the key part here is "substantially differ from the results of the experiments". That sounds like a direct comparison between the current study's results and those of the cited work. 

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for when the citation is used to compare or contrast results. The example given for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained... differ from... (CITSEG)". That matches exactly. 

Let me check the other options to be sure. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, but here it's about results. Support would be if they agreed, but here they differ. Weakness is criticizing, but the passage just states a difference, not a flaw. So yes, CoCoRes is the right choice.
