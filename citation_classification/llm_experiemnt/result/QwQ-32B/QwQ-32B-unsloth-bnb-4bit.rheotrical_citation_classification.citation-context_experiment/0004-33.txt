Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for the (CITSEG) reference. The classes are Basis, CoCoGM, CoCoRes, CoCoXY, Future, Motivation, Neutral, Similar, Support, Usage, Weakness.

First, I need to read the example carefully. The passage says: "Our previous research (CITSEG) has shown that the formation of the hard calcite scale on the surfaces exposed to hard water can be successfully prevented with the applied magnetic field. The explanation of the phenomena is not yet offered and the purpose of this work is to try to understand the mechanism of the beneficial influence of the magnetic treatment."

Hmm, the key here is that the cited work is their own previous research which demonstrated a certain result (preventing scale formation with a magnetic field). Now, the current paper's purpose is to explain the mechanism behind that phenomenon. The citation is pointing out a knowledge gap from their prior work, which motivates the current research. 

Looking at the classes, "Motivation" is when the citation justifies why the current research is being done by identifying a gap or need. The example given for Motivation matches this scenario exactly: previous work showed something, but the explanation is missing, so this new work aims to fill that gap. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. "Basis" would be if the cited work is the foundation for the new solution, but here it's more about the motivation to explore the mechanism. "Support" is when the citation backs a claim, but here it's pointing out a lack of explanation. "Future" is when suggesting future directions, but here the current work is directly addressing the gap. So "Motivation" seems right.
