Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class from the given list. First, I need to carefully read the example passage they gave: 

"The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is to figure out why the citation is being used here. The sentence says that the experimental setup was described in detail in the cited work. That sounds like the current study is using the method or setup from the cited paper. Let me check the classes again to make sure.

Looking at the "Usage" class: "Assign this class when the citation refers to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup from the cited work that is directly used in the current study." The example given for Usage is exactly similar: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." So that's a perfect match. 

Wait, let me make sure none of the other classes fit better. "Basis" is about being the foundation, but here it's more about using the setup. "Support" would be if they were using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's just stating they used the same setup. "Neutral" is possible, but the mention here is specifically about using the experimental setup, which falls under Usage. 

I think "Usage" is the right class here. The citation is referring to a previous description of their experimental setup, so they're using the cited work's method. Yeah, that's definitely Usage.
