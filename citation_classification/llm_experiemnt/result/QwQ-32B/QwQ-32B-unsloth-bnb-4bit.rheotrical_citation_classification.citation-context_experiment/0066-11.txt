Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the correct rhetorical class for the citation in this passage. The user provided the example where the citation is about a peptide that interferes with virus uptake and suggests broader applicability. The example given under the "Future" class is similar, where the citation points to potential future research directions.

The task is to determine if the current citation's purpose is to suggest future research. The example in the prompt for "Future" says something like the peptide's broader applicability is suggested, which implies that the cited work is being used to indicate possible future studies. 

Looking at the classes again: "Future" is when the citation is used to suggest or imply future research directions. The example given here does exactly that by mentioning "suggesting potential broader applicability." That sounds like pointing out an area where more research could be done or where the current work could be applied further, hence indicating a future direction.

Other classes like "Support" would be if the citation is backing up a claim in the current paper, but here it's more about suggesting where the research could go next. "Motivation" is about justifying why the current research is done, but the example here isn't about why the current study was done, but rather about possibilities from the cited work. 

So the correct class here is "Future".
