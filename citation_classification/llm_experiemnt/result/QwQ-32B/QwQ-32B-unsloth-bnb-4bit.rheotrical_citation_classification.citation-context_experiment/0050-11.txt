Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to determine the correct rhetorical class for (CITSEG). The example given is: "The experimental set-up was described in details previously (CITSEG)." 

First, I need to recall the definitions of each class. The key here is that the citation is referring to a method, tool, dataset, or experimental setup used in the current study. The example under the "Usage" class mentions exactly that scenario. 

Looking at the passage, the sentence says the experimental setup was described before in the cited work. That means the current study is using that setup, so the citation is pointing out that they're utilizing a previously described method. 

Let me check other classes to be sure. "Basis" is about foundational work, but here it's more about the setup. "Support" would be if they're using the citation to back up a claim, but here it's about the method used. "Usage" fits perfectly because they're referring to the experimental setup from the cited work being used here. 

No other classes seem to match. "Neutral" is possible, but the mention of the setup being described previously implies direct usage, so "Usage" is better. I think that's the right choice here.
