Okay, let's tackle this classification problem. The user provided a citation passage and wants me to assign the correct rhetorical class. The citation is (CITSEG), and I need to figure out which class it falls into based on the examples given.

First, I need to read the passage carefully. The example given is: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments conducted with the use of deuterium saturated metal targets (TiD, TaD, ZrD, PtD) (CITSEG)."

Hmm, the key here is that the current work's results are being compared directly with the cited work's results. The sentence structure is contrasting the two sets of results. Let me check the classes again.

Looking at the classes, CoCoRes is for comparing results. The example for CoCoRes is similar: "The results obtained in the present work substantially differ from the results of the experiments... (CITSEG)." Wait, that's exactly the same as the example provided here. So the example given in the problem is actually the example for CoCoRes. That must mean the correct class is CoCoRes.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing up with other classes. CoCoGM is about goals or methods, which isn't the case here. Support is when it's used to back up the current findings, but here it's contrasting. Since the example matches CoCoRes exactly, I'm confident that's the right choice.
